"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Niedziela, 2021-12-05\\n\\nCześć Górnicy! Niniejszym rozpoczynamy nasz pierwszy tygodnik Concave Finance - Echo Concave - tworzony przez społeczność Concave.\\n\\nEcho Concave jest tygodnikiem, w którym podsumowujemy najświeższe wiadomości z projektu oraz wyróżniamy najciekawsze znaleziska naszej społeczności. A teraz, bez zbędnych ceregieli, zaczynajmy!\\n\\n# Spis treści\\n\\n* **Etos Concave**\\n* **Dziesięć Jaskinio-przykazań**\\n* **Wywiad z Andym z zespołu**\\n* **Zrzuty NFT stworzonych przez społeczność**\\n* **Badania klonów OHM prowadzone przez społeczność**\\n* **Wkład społeczności**\\n\\n# Etos Concave\\n\\nJuż na początku tworzenia projektu wymyślono słowo, które ukształtowało sedno tego, czym jest Concave - Koopekonkurencja. W przeciwieństwie do zwykłej konkurencji, Koopekonkurencja to strategia, w której każdy pracuje nad tym, w czym jest mocny, aby razem osiągnąć wspólny cel. Zauważyliśmy ten rodzaj współpracy we wszystkich aspektach projektu, takich jak niesamowite badania prowadzone w Centrum Badań, zabawne memy tworzone przez społeczność oraz tłuste bity udostępnione na kanałach kulturowych. Czysty talent i niepohamowana pasja naszej społeczności inspiruje nas do tego stopnia, że w ciągu kilku dni wykonaliśmy pracę wartą cały rok. Jesteśmy naprawdę wdzięczni każdemu górnikowi, który przyczynia się do tego, że ta społeczność jest wyjątkowa. Kiedy słyszymy nawoływanie WAGMI (wszystkim nam się uda) wiemy, że szczerze o to wam chodzi.\\n\\nJeśli chcesz dowiedzieć się więcej o dziejącej się na naszych oczach historii Concave, możesz przeczytać historię jej powstania tutaj.\\n\\n# Dziesięć Jaskinio-przykazań\\n\\nGdy górnicy ze społeczności wykopywali szyb za szybem, przodowi górnicy poprosili członków społeczności o wykonanie różnych zadań. Jedną z próśb, jaką główny zespół skierował do górników ze społeczności, było stworzenie listy zasad panujących w podziemnym mieście Concave. Ten historyczny dokument miał nosić nazwę Dziesięć Jaskinio-przykazań. Dokumentaliści zabrali się do pracy, opracowując regulamin Concave. Oto przykazania ustalone przez społeczność.\\n\\n 1. *Nie będziesz zwał Concave widelcem, lecz łyżką.*\\n 2. *Będziesz zaangażowany, przyjazny i pomocny do górnika twego znajomego.*\\n 3. *Nie będziesz miał lęków przed czeluści jaskiń eksploracją.*\\n 4. *Będziesz czytał i poznawał wszelkie pisma jaskini.*\\n 5. *Będziesz szanował przodków swych - moderatorów swych i programistów swych.*\\n 6. *Nie pozwolisz w biedę innym popaść, lecz łaskę jaskini raczysz im dać.*\\n 7. *Słowo strachu, zwątpienia, ani niepewności z ust twych nie padnie.*\\n 8. *By Panem zostać memów dążył będziesz w jaskini.*\\n 9. *Nie będziesz lubieżności i niecnoty obrazów poza murami #nsfw-culture udostępniał.*\\n10. *Będziesz zapisywał wspomnienia z jaskini, by nigdy nie zostały zapomniane.*\\n\\nMożesz poczytać więcej [tutaj](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1anZwpyCWJWhaoy0PiPSA34yDEh52YMZpkan2KoBFSRs/edit).\\n\\n# Team Interview with Andy\\n\\nA strong community needs a strong core, and the mining core has been busy at work getting Concave Finance to be a powerhouse in the DeFi space. We wanted to drop by and have a short interview with Andy, one of our core miners.\\n\\n**What is your background?**\\n\\nI’ve worn many hats in my professional career. I was a chef for several years before eventually moving on to study Computer Engineering at the University of \\\\[redacted\\\\]-\\\\[redacted\\\\]. Currently, I’m a Solutions Engineer at an enterprise software company.\\n\\n**How did you learn about Concave? (I assume you were part of making it so maybe how were you inspired to make concave)** I met most of the group several years ago online through video games and mutual friends. I’ve been looking for an escape from the wage cage for years, and when I was offered a position on the team I didn’t hesitate to join. Knowing how deep the talent pool runs within the community, it was a no-brainer.\\n\\n**What are your personal hobbies?** I’m a perpetual student, in any spare time I have I’m typically doing some form of research or learning. On a normal day, I’m usually studying at least one course through sites like Udemy or MIT OpenCourseWare. Past that, I’m either blowing off steam in the gym or you can infrequently catch me on League of Legends, Sea of Thieves, or Valorant.\\n\\n**How do you envision Concave Finance in the future?** You don’t have to spend more than a few minutes in #Documentation to see we are going places. I imagine in the not too distant future we see the Concave team grow exponentially to support an enormous, driven community of professional engineers, designers, marketers, meme artists, and everything else. With that in mind, I fully expect the Concave community to dictate the flow of the DeFi movement.\\n\\n**What is a goal that you would like to achieve?** Personally, I want to see everyone involved with the community make it. I firmly believe we have the capacity to get there, and so long as the community continues to produce the top-notch content that we see day in and day out, there’s no reason the Concave spoon can’t feed us all.\\n\\n# Community Made NFT Drops\\n\\nOne area that the Concave community has been eager to explore is NFTs, and many community members couldn’t keep their excitement under control so the community decided to make their own. We have **five** community led NFT projects that are being released as part of the official Concave NFT collection. Here is an introduction to each of them.\\n\\n*Note: A portion of funds generated from Official Concave NFT collection sales will be sent to the Concave Treasury.*\\n\\n**Ponpave NFT Collection**\\n\\nThe [Ponpave](https://twitter.com/Ponpavenft) NFT collection is a Profile Picture NFT collection that draws inspiration from bot Pepe memes and Concave. This project was created by the French community with passion and love. The Ponpave characters will appear in a game that is currently in development. The collection will be released on Opensea and Rarible.\\n\\n**The Concave Spoon NFTs**\\n\\nThe Concave Spoon NFT collection is a project that encapsulates the Concave spirit with a beautiful collection of Concave spoons that miners can use to mine with. There will be 4317 pieces of spoons in this collection as a way to pay homage to the generative art pioneers over at [the Colors](https://twitter.com/thecolorsnft?lang=en). The collection will be released on Opensea.\\n\\n**Universe of Concave**\\n\\nThe Universe of Concave is an NFT collection created as a joint effort between two miners from the French Community, Damdam and Leto. The NFTs were created as inspiration as the two were writing out their thesis on the way to getting the Philosopher role in Concave. They write “All the elements have a meaning, nothing is done at random.” The NFT collection is available for purchase on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/universe-of-concave).\\n\\n**Spoon Cave**\\n\\nSpoon cave is a collection of 10,000 generated NFTs created by a self organizing community group in Concave. Spoon Cave was created by a group of individuals who passionately believe in spoons and have no forks in their lives. You can take a look at the website for more information [here](https://spooncave-mint.netlify.app/).\\n\\n**Secret NFT Project**\\n\\nOne community member created a commemorative NFT artwork that is essentially a beautiful snapshot of the culture channel of Concave. The community member has offered this NFT to the team, and we are looking at cool ways to offer this work of art to the community that inspired it.\\n\\nWe will have a separate article with more information on the NFT projects that will be coming out soon so please look forward to that!\\n\\n# Community led research on OHM Forks\\n\\nOn November 30th, Wookie requested the miners focus on one of the most substantial tasks for the project. The community was requested to create a list of OHM forks and perform a benefit and risk analysis to see which OHM forks Concave should establish connections with. This was a gargantuan task, but the Concave community stepped up to take the challenge. This master fork list is the culmination of the hard work, talent, and dedication from the mining community.\\n\\nIt contains comprehensive analysis, including Bond Control Variables, Growth Metrics over Time, Team Analysis, and Smart Contract Risk Analysis. The miners who put in substantial work in this document earned the Policy role, a prestigious role that is only given to skilled miners who are knowledgeable in this field. Over 160 miners have participated in creating this amazing collaborative document. You can take a look at the sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b0qvbUXgaySP0bU2g2ztCPzoF4-dgWfP_y8UXU9sOkQ/).\\n\\n# Miner of the Week\\n\\nThis week’s Miner of the Week goes to **DeFi Dagoth (∞)#6969** who has written a prayer about Concave for Hard Rock Nick to read. Dagoth reigns from Brazil and is currently busy with a full time job and University. He remembers to say his Gm and Gm everyday and helps the people over in General when he has the time. Dagoth frequents Crypto Twitter often and likes to play strategy games like Crusader Kings. Dagoth is interested in European medieval history, as well as Roman history since its the basis of western civilization. He enjoys the lore of interesting games such as the Elder Scrolls series.\\n\\nYou can see the amazing video that Dagoth commissioned [here](https://twitter.com/DeFiDagoth/status/1464637944501784584?s=20).\\n\\n# Other Community Contributions\\n\\nThe Community Contribution section is a place where we share the some of the amazing work of our mining community. Here are some of the brilliant projects that our community has created this past week.\\n\\n## Meme Newspaper\\n\\nCompilation credit to Stay Fancy#0333\\n\\nThe Meme community in Concave has been on fire ever since the server started. Here is a compilation of some of the community creations that has shown up over the past few days.\\n\\n## Phi Club Findings\\n\\nOver at the Phi Club, our mining philosophers have been hard at work with research and theory crafting to figure out what Concave is. The research and writing that they have done is frankly astounding. Here are some excerpts to show you how amazing some of these papers are.\\n\\n“The statistical properties of spectator forks in an OHM protocol are determined by the FP equation corresponding to the concave equation.\\n\\n∂tP = LFPP ≡ 1 3Hinf ∂φ V 0P + H3 inf 8π 2 ∂ 2 φP\\n\\nWhere LFP denotes the FP operator. The FP equation admits a unique equilibrium distribution.\\n\\nPeq(φ) ∝ exp\\\\[−8π 2V (φ)/(3H4 inf)\\n\\nprovided that the scalar potential increases at large cash values.\\n\\nThe spatial profile of a fork can then be derived from its temporal evolution using bonding, which maps inflation intervals to deflation intervals.**”**\\n\\n\\\\-Leto#9573\\n\\n“What does Concave, a Möbius strip of DeFi look like in 3D space? Is there any way to know? Yes there is! Remember how it was mentioned that the fundamental group of a Möbius strip is {+1, -1}? It turns out that this fundamental group is homeomorphic to the fundamental group of integers. This means that there is an equivalence relationship between the Möbius strip and integers, specifically odd, unique prime numbers p,q.”\\n\\n\\\\-0xEvan(∞)#4567\\n\\nI hope you understand these research papers better than I do.\\n\\n## Concave Emojis & Art\\n\\nEvery community miner needs some emojis and art to use, right? The community created a fantastic list of Concave Emojis & Art for your usage. You can see this list [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16yY5wQz2gAqcA_Lp1LXtPfLWv2JO0cNu4NQzshTwAyM/edit#gid=0).\\n\\nThose contributions are just the tip of the mineshaft of what our community has been able to get done these past few days.\\n\\n## Concave Made Sick Beats\\n\\nConcave doesn’t just have good writers and meme miners; we also have some talented miners that can make some sick beats. Take a listen to Rane#2856’s amazing rap song, Concave Come Up right [here](https://discord.com/channels/910961041003913216/914694073766543391/915518963771899904). 🎧\\n\\n**That’s all for this week miners — we hope you enjoyed this week’s issue of the Concave Lens and look forward to bringing you the next one.**\\n\\n**WAGMI**\",\"timestamp\":1639098917,\"title\":\"Echo Concave - Tygodnik Concave Finance\"},\"digest\":\"dmv_CBlRmlMaEsaX-6MKWamj_rAE7_GNZZf1hzZmTgk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x78F25E5D07Fe45a29E4858206AB86bBEE2419826\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Gu404Oaz3dvC3Qbe1CS_-tgHlojV53RLDAJ8VMryjjQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fSpat-9ZOXafG5tU9BJ6V9oHrIIk61Qffb6wa0v7ZoE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"IgnrtIJ8XQoUG_K3dE4Atq2jsPB2wY1gMPrI6fL_8O9OavpaSzTiRyAckbJ0vWppEb0KspsJXLBxefXJ2pxVIA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x102274ced115b4c36736c0948945cbaddf0df81b82d7ff07c8cc2257b2a0c0a06e85befa9d4c0de6f8b4d099bf2ff6b17a849afe6353f8dfe5692ee1f386fbdf1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Gu404Oaz3dvC3Qbe1CS_-tgHlojV53RLDAJ8VMryjjQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fSpat-9ZOXafG5tU9BJ6V9oHrIIk61Qffb6wa0v7ZoE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"dmv_CBlRmlMaEsaX-6MKWamj_rAE7_GNZZf1hzZmTgk\"}"
