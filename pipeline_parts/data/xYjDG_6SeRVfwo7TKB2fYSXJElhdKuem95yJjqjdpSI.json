"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Remember Isaac? Indeed I do. I shall never forget him. I wonder if he is still living?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Probably not. It is now four years since he was recaptured. I think it would have been impossible to keep him that length of time, unless, of course, he has married that Indian girl. The simplicity of the Indian nature is remarkable. He could easily have deceived them and made them believe he was content in captivity. Probably, in attempting to escape again, he has been killed as was poor Andrew.\\\"\\n\\nBrother and sister gazed with dark, sad eyes into the fire, now burned down to a glowing bed of coals. The silence remained unbroken save for the moan of the rising wind outside, the rattle of hail, and the patter of rain drops on the roof.\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nFort Henry stood on a bluff overlooking the river and commanded a fine view of the surrounding country. In shape it was a parallelogram, being about three hundred and fifty-six feet in length, and one hundred and fifty in width. Surrounded by a stockade fence twelve feet high, with a yard wide walk running around the inside, and with bastions at each corner large enough to contain six defenders, the fort presented an almost impregnable defense. The blockhouse was two stories in height, the second story projecting out several feet over the first. The thick white oak walls bristled with portholes. Besides the blockhouse, there were a number of cabins located within the stockade. Wells had been sunk inside the inclosure, so that if the spring happened to go dry, an abundance of good water could be had at all times.\\n\\nIn all the histories of frontier life mention is made of the forts and the protection they offered in time of savage warfare. These forts were used as homes for the settlers, who often lived for weeks inside the walls.\\n\\nForts constructed entirely of wood without the aid of a nail or spike (for the good reason that these things could not be had) may seem insignificant in these days of great nasal and military garrisons. However, they answered the purpose at that time and served to protect many an infant settlement from the savage attacks of Indian tribes. During a siege of Fort Henry, which had occurred about a year previous, the settlers would have lost scarcely a man had they kept to the fort. But Captain Ogle, at that time in charge of the garrison, had led a company out in search of the Indians. Nearly all of his men were killed, several only making their way to the fort.\\n\\nOn the day following Major McColloch's arrival at Fort Henry, the settlers had been called in from their spring plowing and other labors, and were now busily engaged in moving their stock and the things they wished to save from the destructive torch of the redskin. The women had their hands full with the children, the cleaning of rifles and moulding of bullets, and the thousand and one things the sterner tasks of their husbands had left them. Major McColloch, Jonathan and Silas Zane, early in the day, had taken different directions along the river to keep a sharp lookout for signs of the enemy. Colonel Zane intended to stay in his oven house and defend it, so he had not moved anything to the fort excepting his horses and cattle. Old Sam, the negro, was hauling loads of hay inside the stockade. Captain Boggs had detailed several scouts to watch the roads and one of these was the young man, Clarke, who had accompanied the Major from Fort Pitt.\\n\\nThe appearance of Alfred Clarke, despite the fact that he wore the regulation hunting garb, indicated a young man to whom the hard work and privation of the settler were unaccustomed things. So thought the pioneers who noticed his graceful walk, his fair skin and smooth hands. Yet those who carefully studied his clearcut features were favorably impressed; the women, by the direct, honest gaze of his blue eyes and the absence of ungentle lines in his face; the men, by the good nature, and that indefinable something by which a man marks another as true steel.\\n\\nHe brought nothing with him from Fort Pitt except his horse, a black-coated, fine limbed thoroughbred, which he frankly confessed was all he could call his own. When asking Colonel Zane to give him a position in the garrison he said he was a Virginian and had been educated in Philadelphia; that after his father died his mother married again, and this, together with a natural love of adventure, had induced him to run away and seek his fortune with the hardy pioneer and the cunning savage of the border. Beyond a few months' service under General Clark he knew nothing of frontier life; but he was tired of idleness; he was strong and not afraid of work, and he could learn. Colonel Zane, who prided himself on his judgment of character, took a liking to the young man at once, and giving him a rifle and accoutrements, told him the border needed young men of pluck and fire, and that if he brought a strong hand and a willing heart he could surely find fortune. Possibly if Alfred Clarke could have been told of the fate in store for him he might have mounted his black steed and have placed miles between him and the frontier village; but, as there were none to tell, he went cheerfully out to meet that fate.\\n\\nOn this is bright spring morning he patrolled the road leading along the edge of the clearing, which was distant a quarter of a mile from the fort. He kept a keen eye on the opposite side of the river, as he had been directed. From the upper end of the island, almost straight across from where he stood, the river took a broad turn, which could not be observed from the fort windows. The river was high from the recent rains and brush heaps and logs and debris of all descriptions were floating down with the swift current. Rabbits and other small animals, which had probably been surrounded on some island and compelled to take to the brush or drown, crouched on floating logs and piles of driftwood. Happening to glance down the road, Clarke saw a horse galloping in his direction At first he thought it was a messenger for himself, but as it neared him he saw that the horse was an Indian pony and the rider a young girl, whose long, black hair was flying in the wind.\\n\\n\\\"Hello! I wonder what the deuce this is? Looks like an Indian girl,\\\" said Clarke to himself. \\\"She rides well, whoever she may be.\\\"\\n\\nHe stepped behind a clump of laurel bushes near the roadside and waited. Rapidly the horse and rider approached him. When they were but a few paces distant he sprang out and, as the pony shied and reared at sight of him, he clutched the bridle and pulled the pony's head down. Looking up he encountered the astonished and bewildered gaze from a pair of the prettiest dark eyes it had ever been his fortune, or misfortune, to look into.\\n\\nBetty, for it was she, looked at the young man in amazement, while Alfred was even more surprised and disconcerted. For a moment they looked at each other in silence. But Betty, who was scarcely ever at a loss for words, presently found her voice.\\n\\n\\\"Well, sir! What does this mean?\\\" she asked indignantly.\\n\\n\\\"It means that you must turn around and go back to the fort,\\\" answered Alfred, also recovering himself.\\n\\nNow Betty's favorite ride happened to be along this road. It lay along the top of the bluff a mile or more and afforded a fine unobstructed view of the river. Betty had either not heard of the Captain's order, that no one was to leave the fort, or she had disregarded it altogether; probably the latter, as she generally did what suited her fancy.\\n\\n\\\"Release my pony's head!\\\" she cried, her face flushing, as she gave a jerk to the reins. \\\"How dare you? What right have you to detain me?\\\"\\n\\nThe expression Betty saw on Clarke's face was not new to her, for she remembered having seen it on the faces of young gentlemen whom she had met at her aunt's house in Philadelphia. It was the slight, provoking smile of the man familiar with the various moods of young women, the expression of an amused contempt for their imperiousness. But it was not that which angered Betty. It was the coolness with which he still held her pony regardless of her commands.\\n\\n\\\"Pray do not get excited,\\\" he said. \\\"I am sorry I cannot allow such a pretty little girl to have her own way. I shall hold your pony until you say you will go back to the fort.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sir!\\\" exclaimed Betty, blushing a bright-red. \\\"You--you are impertinent!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not at all,\\\" answered Alfred, with a pleasant laugh. \\\"I am sure I do not intend to be. Captain Boggs did not acquaint me with full particulars or I might have declined my present occupation: not, however, that it is not agreeable just at this moment. He should have mentioned the danger of my being run down by Indian ponies and imperious young ladies.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Will you let go of that bridle, or shall I get off and walk back for assistance?\\\" said Betty, getting angrier every moment.\\n\\n\\\"Go back to the fort at once,\\\" ordered Alfred, authoritatively. \\\"Captain Boggs' orders are that no one shall be allowed to leave the clearing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh! Why did you not say so? I thought you were Simon Girty, or a highwayman. Was it necessary to keep me here all this time to explain that you were on duty?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You know sometimes it is difficult to explain,\\\" said Alfred, \\\"besides, the situation had its charm. No, I am not a robber, and I don't believe you thought so. I have only thwarted a young lady's whim, which I am aware is a great crime. I am very sorry. Goodbye.\\\"\\n\\nBetty gave him a withering glance from her black eyes, wheeled her pony and galloped away. A mellow laugh was borne to her ears before she got out of hearing, and again the red blood mantled her cheeks.\\n\\n\\\"Heavens! What a little beauty,\\\" said Alfred to himself, as he watched the graceful rider disappear. \\\"What spirit! Now, I wonder who she can be. She had on moccasins and buckskin gloves and her hair tumbled like a tomboy's, but she is no backwoods girl, I'll bet on that. I'm afraid I was a little rude, but after taking such a stand I could not weaken, especially before such a haughty and disdainful little vixen. It was too great a temptation. What eyes she had! Contrary to what I expected, this little frontier settlement bids fair to become interesting.\\\"\\n\\nThe afternoon wore slowly away, and until late in the day nothing further happened to disturb Alfred's meditations, which consisted chiefly of different mental views and pictures of red lips and black eyes. Just as he decided to return to the fort for his supper he heard the barking of a dog that he had seen running along the road some moments before. The sound came from some distance down the river bank and nearer the fort. Walking a few paces up the bluff Alfred caught sight of a large black dog running along the edge of the water. He would run into the water a few paces and then come out and dash along the shore. He barked furiously all the while. Alfred concluded that he must have been excited by a fox or perhaps a wolf; so he climbed down the steep bank and spoke to the dog. Thereupon the dog barked louder and more fiercely than ever, ran to the water, looked out into the river and then up at the man with almost human intelligence.\\n\\nAlfred understood. He glanced out over the muddy water, at first making out nothing but driftwood. Then suddenly he saw a log with an object clinging to it which he took to be a man, and an Indian at that. Alfred raised his rifle to his shoulder and was in the act of pressing the trigger when he thought he heard a faint halloo. Looking closer, he found he was not covering the smooth polished head adorned with the small tuft of hair, peculiar to a redskin on the warpath, but a head from which streamed long black hair.\\n\\nAlfred lowered his rifle and studied intently the log with its human burden. Drifting with the current it gradually approached the bank, and as it came nearer he saw that it bore a white man, who was holding to the log with one hand and with the other was making feeble strokes. He concluded the man was either wounded or nearly drowned, for his movements were becoming slower and weaker every moment. His white face lay against the log and barely above water. Alfred shouted encouraging words to him.\\n\\nAt the bend of the river a little rocky point jutted out a few yards into the water. As the current carried the log toward this point, Alfred, after divesting himself of some of his clothing, plunged in and pulled it to the shore. The pallid face of the man clinging to the log showed that he was nearly exhausted, and that he had been rescued in the nick of time. When Alfred reached shoal water he slipped his arm around the man, who was unable to stand, and carried him ashore.\\n\\nThe rescued man wore a buckskin hunting shirt and leggins and moccasins of the same material, all very much the worse for wear. The leggins were torn into tatters and the moccasins worn through. His face was pinched with suffering and one arm was bleeding from a gunshot wound near the shoulder.\\n\\n\\\"Can you not speak? Who are you?\\\" asked Clarke, supporting the limp figure.\\n\\nThe man made several efforts to answer, and finally said something that to\\n\\nAlfred sounded like \\\"Zane,\\\" then he fell to the ground unconscious.\\n\\nAll this time the dog had acted in a most peculiar manner, and if Alfred had not been so intent on the man he would have noticed the animal's odd maneuvers. He ran to and fro on the sandy beach; he scratched up the sand and pebbles, sending them flying in the air; he made short, furious dashes; he jumped, whirled, and, at last, crawled close to the motionless figure and licked its hand.\\n\\nClarke realized that he would not be able to carry the inanimate figure, so he hurriedly put on his clothes and set out on a run for Colonel Zane's house. The first person whom he saw was the odd negro slave, who was brushing one of the Colonel's horses.\\n\\nSam was deliberate and took his time about everything. He slowly looked up and surveyed Clarke with his rolling eyes. He did not recognize in him any one he had ever seen before, and being of a sullen and taciturn nature, especially with strangers, he seemed in no hurry to give the desired information as to Colonel Zane's whereabouts.\\n\\n\\\"Don't stare at me that way, you damn nigger,\\\" said Clarke, who was used to being obeyed by negroes. \\\"Quick, you idiot. Where is the Colonel?\\\"\\n\\nAt that moment Colonel Zane came out of the barn and started to speak, when Clarke interrupted him.\\n\\n\\\"Colonel, I have just pulled a man out of the river who says his name is Zane, or if he did not mean that, he knows you, for he surely said 'Zane.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What!\\\" ejaculated the Colonel, letting his pipe fall from his mouth.\\n\\nClarke related the circumstances in a few hurried words. Calling Sam they ran quickly down to the river, where they found the prostrate figure as Clarke had left it, the dog still crouched close by.\\n\\n\\\"My God! It is Isaac!\\\" exclaimed Colonel Zane, when he saw the white face. \\\"Poor boy, he looks as if he were dead. Are you sure he spoke? Of course he must have spoken for you could not have known. Yes, his heart is still beating.\\\"\\n\\nColonel Zane raised his head from the unconscious man's breast, where he had laid it to listen for the beating heart.\\n\\n\\\"Clarke, God bless you for saving him,\\\" said he fervently. \\\"It shall never be forgotten. He is alive, and, I believe, only exhausted, for that wound amounts to little. Let us hurry.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I did not save him. It was the dog,\\\" Alfred made haste to answer.\\n\\nThey carried the dripping form to the house, where the door was opened by Mrs. Zane.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, dear, another poor man,\\\" she said, pityingly. Then, as she saw his face, \\\"Great Heavens, it is Isaac! Oh! don't say he is dead!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, it is Isaac, and he is worth any number of dead men yet,\\\" said Colonel Zane, as they laid the insensible man on the couch. \\\"Bessie, there is work here for you. He has been shot.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is there any other wound beside this one in his arm?\\\" asked Mrs. Zane, examining it.\\n\\n\\\"I do not think so, and that injury is not serious. It is lose of blood, exposure and starvation. Clarke, will you please run over to Captain Boggs and tell Betty to hurry home! Sam, you get a blanket and warm it by the fire. That's right, Bessie, bring the whiskey,\\\" and Colonel Zane went on giving orders.\\n\\nAlfred did not know in the least who Betty was, but, as he thought that unimportant, he started off on a run for the fort. He had a vague idea that Betty was the servant, possibly Sam's wife, or some one of the Colonel's several slaves.\\n\\nLet us return to Betty. As she wheeled her pony and rode away from the scene of her adventure on the river bluff, her state of mind can be more readily imagined than described. Betty hated opposition of any kind, whether justifiable or not; she wanted her own way, and when prevented from doing as she pleased she invariably got angry. To be ordered and compelled to give up her ride, and that by a stranger, was intolerable. To make it all the worse this stranger had been decidedly flippant. He had familiarly spoken to her as \\\"a pretty little girl.\\\" Not only that, which was a great offense, but he had stared at her, and she had a confused recollection of a gaze in which admiration had been ill disguised. Of course, it was that soldier Lydia had been telling her about. Strangers were of so rare an occurrence in the little village that it was not probable there could be more than one.\\n\\nApproaching the house she met her brother who told her she had better go indoors and let Sam put up the pony. Accordingly, Betty called the negro, and then went into the house. Bessie had gone to the fort with the children. Betty found no one to talk to, so she tried to read. Finding she could not become interested she threw the book aside and took up her embroidery. This also turned out a useless effort; she got the linen hopelessly twisted and tangled, and presently she tossed this upon the table. Throwing her shawl over her shoulders, for it was now late in the afternoon and growing chilly, she walked downstairs and out into the Yard. She strolled aimlessly to and fro awhile, and then went over to the fort and into Captain Bogg's house, which adjoined the blockhouse. Here she found Lydia preparing flax.\\n\\n\\\"I saw you racing by on your pony. Goodness, how you can ride! I should be afraid of breaking my neck,\\\" exclaimed Lydia, as Betty entered.\\n\\n\\\"My ride was spoiled,\\\" said Betty, petulantly.\\n\\n\\\"Spoiled? By what--whom?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"By a man, of course,\\\" retorted Betty, whose temper still was high. \\\"It is always a man that spoils everything.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, Betty, what in the world do you mean? I never heard you talk that way,\\\" said Lydia, opening her blue eyes in astonishment.\\n\\n\\\"Well, Lyde, I'll tell you. I was riding down the river road and just as I came to the end of the clearing a man jumped out from behind some bushes and grasped Madcap's bridle. Imagine! For a moment I was frightened out of my wits. I instantly thought of the Girtys, who, I have heard, have evinced a fondness for kidnapping little girls. Then the fellow said he was on guard and ordered me, actually commanded me to go home.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, is that all?\\\" said Lydia, laughing.\\n\\n\\\"No, that is not all. He--he said I was a pretty little girl and that he was sorry I could not have my own way; that his present occupation was pleasant, and that the situation had its charm. The very idea. He was most impertinent,\\\" and Betty's telltale cheeks reddened again at the recollection.\\n\\n\\\"Betty, I do not think your experience was so dreadful, certainly nothing to put you out as it has,\\\" said Lydia, laughing merrily. \\\"Be serious. You know we are not in the backwoods now and must not expect so much of the men. These rough border men know little of refinement like that with which you have been familiar. Some of them are quiet and never speak unless addressed; their simplicity is remarkable; Lew Wetzel and your brother Jonathan, when they are not fighting Indians, are examples. On the other hand, some of them are boisterous and if they get anything to drink they will make trouble for you. Why, I went to a party one night after I had been here only a few weeks and they played a game in which every man in the place kissed me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gracious! Please tell me when any such games are likely to be proposed and I'll stay home,\\\" said Betty.\\n\\n\\\"I have learned to get along very well by simply making the best of it,\\\" continued Lydia. \\\"And to tell the truth, I have learned to respect these rugged fellows. They are uncouth; they have no manners, but their hearts are honest and true, and that is of much greater importance in frontiersmen than the little attentions and courtesies upon which women are apt to lay too much stress.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think you speak sensibly and I shall try and be more reasonable hereafter. But, to return to the man who spoiled my ride. He, at least, is no frontiersman, notwithstanding his gun and his buckskin suit. He is an educated man. His manner and accent showed that. Then he looked at me so differently. I know it was that soldier from Fort Pitt.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Clarke? Why, of course!\\\" exclaimed Lydia, clapping her hands in glee. \\\"How stupid of me!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You seem to be amused,\\\" said Betty, frowning.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Betty, it is such a good joke.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is it? I fail to see it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I can. I am very much amused. You see, I heard Mr. Clarke say, after papa told him there were lots of pretty girls here, that he usually succeeded in finding those things out and without any assistance. And the very first day he has met you and made you angry. It is delightful.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lyde, I never knew you could be so horrid.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is evident that Mr. Clarke is not only discerning, but not backward in expressing his thoughts. Betty, I see a romance.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't be ridiculous,\\\" retorted Betty, with an angry blush. \\\"Of course, he had a right to stop me, and perhaps he did me a good turn by keeping me inside the clearing, though I cannot imagine why he hid behind the bushes. But he might have been polite. He made me angry. He was so cool and--and--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I see,\\\" interrupted Lydia, teasingly. \\\"He failed to recognize your importance.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nonsense, Lydia. I hope you do not think I am a silly little fool. It is only that I have not been accustomed to that kind of treatment, and I will not have it.\\\"\\n\\nLydia was rather pleased that some one had appeared on the scene who did not at once bow down before Betty, and therefore she took the young man's side of the argument.\\n\\n\\\"Do not be hard on poor Mr. Clarke. Maybe he mistook you for an Indian girl. He is handsome. I am sure you saw that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I don't remember how he looked,\\\" said Betty. She did remember, but would not admit it.\\n\\nThe conversation drifted into other channels after this, and soon twilight came stealing down on them. As Betty rose to go there came a hurried tap on the door.\\n\\n\\\"I wonder who would knock like that,\\\" said Lydia, rising \\\"Betty, wait a moment while I open the door.\\\"\\n\\nOn doing this she discovered Clarke standing on the step with his cap in his hand.\\n\\n\\\"Why, Mr. Clarke! Will you come in?\\\" exclaimed Lydia. \\\"Thank you, only for a moment,\\\" said Alfred. \\\"I cannot stay. I came to find Betty. Is she here?\\\"\\n\\nHe had not observed Betty, who had stepped back into the shadow of the darkening room. At his question Lydia became so embarrassed she did not know what to say or do, and stood looking helplessly at him.\\n\\nBut Betty was equal to the occasion. At the mention of her first name in such a familiar manner by this stranger, who had already grievously offended her once before that day, Betty stood perfectly still a moment, speechless with surprise, then she stepped quickly out of the shadow.\\n\\nClarke turned as he heard her step and looked straight into a pair of dark, scornful eyes and a face pale with anger.\\n\\n\\\"If it be necessary that you use my name, and I do not see how that can be possible, will you please have courtesy enough to say Miss Zane?\\\" she cried haughtily.\\n\\nLydia recovered her composure sufficiently to falter out:\\n\\n\\\"Betty, allow me to introduce--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do not trouble yourself, Lydia. I have met this person once before to-day, and I do not care for an introduction.\\\"\\n\\nWhen Alfred found himself gazing into the face that had haunted him all the afternoon, he forgot for the moment all about his errand. He was finally brought to a realization of the true state of affairs by Lydia's words.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Clarke, you are all wet. What has happened?\\\" she exclaimed, noticing the water dripping from his garments.\\n\\nSuddenly a light broke in on Alfred. So the girl he had accosted on the road and \\\"Betty\\\" were one and the same person. His face flushed. He felt that his rudeness on that occasion may have merited censure, but that it had not justified the humiliation she had put upon him.\\n\\nThese two persons, so strangely brought together, and on whom Fate had made her inscrutable designs, looked steadily into each other's eyes. What mysterious force thrilled through Alfred Clarke and made Betty Zane tremble?\\n\\n\\\"Miss Boggs, I am twice unfortunate,\\\" said Alfred, tuning to Lydia, and there was an earnest ring in his deep voice \\\"This time I am indeed blameless. I have just left Colonel Zane's house, where there has been an accident, and I was dispatched to find 'Betty,' being entirely ignorant as to who she might be. Colonel Zane did not stop to explain. Miss Zane is needed at the house, that is all.\\\"\\n\\nAnd without so much as a glance at Betty he bowed low to Lydia and then strode out of the open door.\\n\\n\\\"What did he say?\\\" asked Betty, in a small trembling voice, all her anger and resentment vanished.\\n\\n\\\"There has been an accident. He did not say what or to whom. You must hurry home. Oh, Betty, I hope no one hat been hurt! And you were very unkind to Mr. Clarke. I am sure he is a gentleman, and you might have waited a moment to learn what he meant.\\\"\\n\\nBetty did not answer, but flew out of the door and down the path to the gate of the fort. She was almost breathless when she reached Colonel Zane's house, and hesitated on the step before entering. Summoning her courage she pushed open the door. The first thing that struck her after the bright light was the pungent odor of strong liniment. She saw several women neighbors whispering together. Major McColloch and Jonathan Zane were standing by a couch over which Mrs. Zane was bending. Colonel Zane sat at the foot of the couch. Betty saw this in the first rapid glance, and then, as the Colonel's wife moved aside, she saw a prostrate figure, a white face and dark eyes that smiled at her.\\n\\n\\\"Betty,\\\" came in a low voice from those pale lips.\\n\\nHer heart leaped and then seemed to cease beating. Many long years had passed since she had heard that voice, but it had never been forgotten. It was the best beloved voice of her childhood, and with it came the sweet memories of her brother and playmate. With a cry of joy she fell on her knees beside him and threw her arms around his neck.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Isaac, brother, brother!\\\" she cried, as she kissed him again and again. \\\"Can it really be you? Oh, it is too good to be true! Thank God! I have prayed and prayed that you would be restored to us.\\\"\\n\\nThen she began to cry and laugh at the same time in that strange way in which a woman relieves a heart too full of joy. \\\"Yes, Betty. It is all that is left of me,\\\" he said, running his hand caressingly over the dark head that lay on his breast.\\n\\n\\\"Betty, you must not excite him,\\\" said Colonel Zane.\\n\\n\\\"So you have not forgotten me?\\\" whispered Isaac.\\n\\n\\\"No, indeed, Isaac. I have never forgotten,\\\" answered Betty, softly. \\\"Only last night I spoke of you and wondered if you were living. And now you are here. Oh, I am so happy!\\\" The quivering lips and the dark eyes bright with tears spoke eloquently of her joy.\\n\\n\\\"Major will you tell Captain Boggs to come over after supper? Isaac will be able to talk a little by then, and he has some news of the Indians,\\\" said Colonel Zane.\\n\\n\\\"And ask the young man who saved my life to come that I may thank him,\\\" said Isaac.\\n\\n\\\"Saved your life?\\\" exclaimed Betty, turning to her brother, in surprise, while a dark red flush spread over her face. A humiliating thought had flashed into her mind.\\n\\n\\\"Saved his life, of course,\\\" said Colonel Zane, answering for Isaac. \\\"Young Clarke pulled him out of the river. Didn't he tell you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Betty, rather faintly.\\n\\n\\\"Well, he is a modest young fellow. He saved Isaac's life, there is no doubt of that. You will hear all about it after supper. Don't make Isaac talk any more at present.\\\"\\n\\nBetty hid her face on Isaac's shoulder and remained quiet a few moments; then, rising, she kissed his cheek and went quietly to her room. Once there she threw herself on the bed and tried to think. The events of the day, coming after a long string of monotonous, wearying days, had been confusing; they had succeeded one another in such rapid order as to leave no time for reflection. The meeting by the river with the rude but interesting stranger; the shock to her dignity; Lydia's kindly advice; the stranger again, this time emerging from the dark depths of disgrace into the luminous light as the hero of her brother's rescue--all these thoughts jumbled in her mind making it difficult for her to think clearly. But after a time one thing forced itself upon her. She could not help being conscious that she had wronged some one to whom she would be forever indebted. Nothing could alter that. She was under an eternal obligation to the man who had saved the life she loved best on earth. She had unjustly scorned and insulted the man to whom she owed the life of her brother.\\n\\nBetty was passionate and quick-tempered, but she was generous and tender-hearted as well, and when she realized how unkind and cruel she kind been she felt very miserable. Her position admitted of no retreat. No matter how much pride rebelled; no matter how much she disliked to retract anything she had said, she knew no other course lay open to her. She would have to apologize to Mr. Clarke. How could she? What would she say? She remembered how cold and stern his face had been as he turned from her to Lydia. Perplexed and unhappy, Betty did what any girl in her position would have done: she resorted to the consoling and unfailing privilege of her sex--a good cry.\\n\\nWhen she became composed again she got up and bathed her hot cheeks, brushed her hair, and changed her gown for a becoming one of white. She tied a red ribbon about her throat and put a rosette in her hair. She had forgotten all about the Indians. By the time Mrs. Zane called her for supper she had her mind made up to ask Mr. Clarke's pardon, tell him she was sorry, and that she hoped they might be friends.\\n\\nIsaac Zane's fame had spread from the Potomac to Detroit and Louisville. Many an anxious mother on the border used the story of his captivity as a means to frighten truant youngsters who had evinced a love for running wild in the woods. The evening of Isaac's return every one in the settlement called to welcome home the wanderer. In spite of the troubled times and the dark cloud hanging over them they made the occasion one of rejoicing.\\n\\nOld John Bennet, the biggest and merriest man in the colony, came in and roared his appreciation of Isaac's return. He was a huge man, and when he stalked into the room he made the floor shake with his heavy tread. His honest face expressed his pleasure as he stood over Isaac and nearly crushed his hand.\\n\\n\\\"Glad to see you, Isaac. Always knew you would come back. Always said so. There are not enough damn redskins on the river to keep you prisoner.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think they managed to keep him long enough,\\\" remarked Silas Zane.\\n\\n\\\"Well, here comes the hero,\\\" said Colonel Zane, as Clarke entered, accompanied by Captain Boggs, Major McColloch and Jonathan. \\\"Any sign of Wetzel or the Indians?\\\"\\n\\nJonathan had not yet seen his brother, and he went over and seized Isaac's hand and wrung it without speaking.\\n\\n\\\"There are no Indians on this side of the river,\\\" said Major McColloch, in answer to the Colonel's question.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Clarke, you do not seem impressed with your importance,\\\" said Colonel Zane. \\\"My sister said you did not tell her what part you took in Isaac's rescue.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hardly deserve all the credit,\\\" answered Alfred. \\\"Your big black dog merits a great deal of it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I consider your first day at the fort a very satisfactory one, and an augury of that fortune you came west to find.\\n\\n\\\"How are you?\\\" said Alfred, going up to the couch where Isaac lay.\\n\\n\\\"I am doing well, thanks to you,\\\" said Isaac, warmly shaking Alfred's hand.\\n\\n\\\"It is good to see you pulling out all right,\\\" answered Alfred. \\\"I tell you, I feared you were in a bad way when I got you out of the water.\\\"\\n\\nIsaac reclined on the couch with his head and shoulder propped up by pillows. He was the handsomest of the brothers. His face would have been but for the marks of privation, singularly like Betty's; the same low, level brows and dark eyes; the same mouth, though the lips were stronger and without the soft curves which made his sister's mouth so sweet.\\n\\nBetty appeared at the door, and seeing the room filled with men she hesitated a moment before coming forward. In her white dress she made such a dainty picture that she seemed out of place among those surroundings. Alfred Clarke, for one, thought such a charming vision was wasted on the rough settlers, every one of whom wore a faded and dirty buckskin suit and a belt containing a knife and a tomahawk. Colonel Zane stepped up to Betty and placing his arm around her turned toward Clarke with pride in his eyes.\\n\\n\\\"Betty, I want to make you acquainted with the hero of the hour, Mr. Alfred Clarke. This is my sister.\\\"\\n\\nBetty bowed to Alfred, but lowered her eyes instantly on encountering the young man's gaze.\\n\\n\\\"I have had the pleasure of meeting Miss Zane twice today,\\\" said Alfred.\\n\\n\\\"Twice?\\\" asked Colonel Zane, turning to Betty. She did not answer, but disengaged herself from his arm and sat down by Isaac.\\n\\n\\\"It was on the river road that I first met Miss Zane, although I did not know her then,\\\" answered Alfred. \\\"I had some difficulty in stopping her pony from going to Fort Pitt, or some other place down the river.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ha! Ha! Well, I know she rides that pony pretty hard,\\\" said Colonel Zane, with his hearty laugh. \\\"I'll tell you, Clarke, we have some riders here in the settlement. Have you heard of Major McColloch's leap over the hill?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have heard it mentioned, and I would like to hear the story,\\\" responded Alfred. \\\"I am fond of horses, and think I can ride a little myself. I am afraid I shall be compelled to change my mind.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is a fine animal you rode from Fort Pitt,\\\" remarked the Major. \\\"I would like to own him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come, draw your chairs up and he'll listen to Isaac's story,\\\" said Colonel Zane.\\n\\n\\\"I have not much of a story to tell,\\\" said Isaac, in a voice still weak and low. \\\"I have some bad news, I am sorry to say, but I shall leave that for the last. This year, if it had been completed, would have made my tenth year as a captive of the Wyandots. This last period of captivity, which has been nearly four years, I have not been ill-treated and have enjoyed more comfort than any of you can imagine. Probably you are all familiar with the reason for my long captivity. Because of the interest of Myeerah, the Indian Princess, they have importuned me for years to be adopted into the tribe, marry the White Crane, as they call Myeerah, and become a Wyandot chief. To this I would never consent, though I have been careful not to provoke the Indians. I was allowed the freedom of the camp, but have always been closely watched. I should still be with the Indians had I not suspected that Hamilton, the British Governor, had formed a plan with the Hurons, Shawnees, Delawares, and other tribes, to strike a terrible blow at the whites along, the river. For months I have watched the Indians preparing for an expedition, the extent of which they had never before undertaken. I finally learned from Myeerah that my suspicions were well founded. A favorable chance to escape presented and I took it and got away. I outran all the braves, even Arrowswift, the Wyandot runner, who shot me through the arm. I have had a hard time of it these last three or four days, living on herbs and roots, and when I reached the river I was ready to drop. I pushed a log into the water and started to drift over. When the old dog saw me I knew I was safe if I could hold on. Once, when the young man pointed his gun at me, I thought it was all over. I could not shout very loud.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Were you going to shoot?\\\" asked Colonel Zane of Clarke.\\n\\n\\\"I took him for an Indian, but fortunately I discovered my mistake in time,\\\" answered Alfred.\\n\\n\\\"Are the Indians on the way here?\\\" asked Jonathan.\\n\\n\\\"That I cannot say. At present the Wyandots are at home. But I know that the British and the Indians will make a combined attack on the settlements. It may be a month, or a year, but it is coming.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And Hamilton, the hair buyer, the scalp buyer, is behind the plan,\\\" said Colonel Zane, in disgust.\\n\\n\\\"The Indians have their wrongs. I sympathize with them in many ways. We have robbed them, broken faith with them, and have not lived up to the treaties. Pipe and Wingenund are particularly bitter toward the whites. I understand Cornplanter is also. He would give anything for Jonathan's scalp, and I believe any of the tribes would give a hundred of their best warriors for 'Black Wind,' as they call Lew Wetzel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you ever seen Red Fox?\\\" asked Jonathan, who was sitting near the fire and as usual saying but little. He was the wildest and most untamable of all the Zanes. Most of the time he spent in the woods, not so much to fight Indians, as Wetzel did, but for pure love of outdoor life. At home he was thoughtful and silent.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I have seen him,\\\" answered Isaac. \\\"He is a Shawnee chief and one of the fiercest warriors in that tribe of fighters. He was at Indian-head, which is the name of one of the Wyandot villages, when I visited there last, and he had two hundred of his best braves with him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is a bad Indian. Wetzel and I know him. He swore he would hang our scalps up in his wigwam,\\\" said Jonathan.\\n\\n\\\"What has he in particular against you?\\\" asked Colonel Zane. \\\"Of course, Wetzel is the enemy of all Indians.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Several years ago Wetzel and I were on a hunt down the river at the place called Girty's Point, where we fell in with the tracks of five Shawnees. I was for coming home, but Wetzel would not hear of it. We trailed the Indians and, coming up on them after dark, we tomahawked them. One of them got away crippled, but we could not follow him because we discovered that they had a white girl as captive, and one of the red devils, thinking we were a rescuing party, had tomahawked her. She was not quite dead. We did all we could to save her life. She died and we buried her on the spot. They were Red Fox's braves and were on their way to his camp with the prisoner. A year or so afterwards I learned from a friendly Indian that the Shawnee chief had sworn to kill us. No doubt he will be a leader in the coming attack.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We are living in the midst of terrible times,\\\" remarked Colonel Zane. \\\"Indeed, these are the times that try men's souls, but I firmly believe the day is not far distant when the redmen will be driven far over the border.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is the Indian Princess pretty?\\\" asked Betty of Isaac.\\n\\n\\\"Indeed she is, Betty, almost as beautiful as you are,\\\" said Isaac. \\\"She is tall and very fair for an Indian. But I have something to tell about her more interesting than that. Since I have been with the Wyandots this last time I have discovered a little of the jealously guarded secret of Myeerah's mother. When Tarhe and his band of Hurons lived in Canada their home was in the Muskoka Lakes region on the Moon river. The old warriors tell wonderful stories of the beauty of that country. Tarhe took captive some French travellers, among them a woman named La Durante. She had a beautiful little girl. The prisoners, except this little girl, were released. When she grew up Tarhe married her. Myeerah is her child. Once Tarhe took his wife to Detroit and she was seen there by an old Frenchman who went crazy over her and said she was his child. Tarhe never went to the white settlements again. So you see, Myeerah is from a great French family on her mother's side, as this is old Frenchman was probably Chevalier La Durante, and Myeerah's grandfather.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I would love to see her, and yet I hate her. What an odd name she has,\\\" said Betty.\\n\\n\\\"It is the Indian name for the white crane, a rare and beautiful bird. I never saw one. The name has been celebrated among the Hurons as long as any one of them can remember. The Indians call her the White Crane, or Walk-in-the-Water,\\n\\nbecause of her love for wading in the stream.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think we have made Isaac talk enough for one night,\\\" said Colonel Zane. \\\"He is tired out. Major, tell Isaac and Betty, and Mr. Clarke, too, of your jump over the cliff.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have heard of that leap from the Indians,\\\" said Isaac.\\n\\n\\\"Major, from what hill did you jump your horse?\\\" asked Alfred.\\n\\n\\\"You know the bare rocky bluff that stands out prominently on the hill across the creek. From that spot Colonel Zane first saw the valley, and from there I leaped my horse. I can never convince myself that it really happened. Often I look up at that cliff in doubt. But the Indians and Colonel Zane, Jonathan, Wetzel and others say they actually saw the deed done, so I must accept it,\\\" said Major McColloch.\\n\\n\\\"It seems incredible!\\\" said Alfred. \\\"I cannot understand how a man or horse could go over that precipice and live.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is what we all say,\\\" responded the Colonel. \\\"I suppose I shall have to tell the story. We have fighters and makers of history here, but few talkers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am anxious to hear it,\\\" answered Clarke, \\\"and I am curious to see this man Wetzel, whose fame has reached as far as my home, way down in Virginia.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You will have your wish gratified soon, I have no doubt,\\\" resumed the Colonel. \\\"Well, now for the story of McColloch's mad ride for life and his wonderful leap down Wheeling hill. A year ago, when the fort was besieged by the Indians, the Major got through the lines and made off for Short Creek. He returned next morning with forty mounted men. They marched boldly up to the gate, and all succeeded in getting inside save the gallant Major, who had waited to be the last man to go in. Finding it impossible to make the short distance without going under the fire of the Indians, who had rushed up to prevent the relief party from entering the fort, he wheeled his big stallion, and, followed by the yelling band of savages, he took the road leading around back of the fort to the top of the bluff. The road lay along the edge of the cliff and I saw the Major turn and wave his rifle at us, evidently with the desire of assuring us that he was safe. Suddenly, on the very summit of the hill, he reined in his horse as if undecided. I knew in an instant what had happened. The Major had run right into the returning party of Indians, which had been sent out to intercept our reinforcements. In a moment more we heard the exultant yells of the savages, and saw them gliding from tree to tree, slowly lengthening out their line and surrounding the unfortunate Major. They did not fire a shot. We in the fort were stupefied with horror, and stood helplessly with our useless guns, watching and waiting for the seemingly inevitable doom of our comrade. Not so with the Major! Knowing that he was a marked man by the Indians and feeling that any death was preferable to the gauntlet, the knife, the stake and torch of the merciless savage, he had grasped at a desperate chance. He saw his enemies stealthily darting from rock to tree, and tree to bush, creeping through the brush, and slipping closer and closer every moment. On three sides were his hated foes and on the remaining side--the abyss. Without a moment's hesitation the intrepid Major spurred his horse at the precipice. Never shall I forget that thrilling moment. The three hundred savages were silent as they realized the Major's intention. Those in the fort watched with staring eyes. A few bounds and the noble steed reared high on his hind legs. Outlined by the clear blue sky the magnificent animal stood for one brief instant, his black mane flying in the wind, his head thrown up and his front hoofs pawing the air like Marcus Curtius' mailed steed of old, and then down with a crash, a cloud of dust, and the crackling of pine limbs. A long yell went up from the Indians below, while those above ran to the edge of the cliff. With cries of wonder and baffled vengeance they gesticulated toward the dark ravine into which horse and rider had plunged rather than wait to meet a more cruel death. The precipice at this point is over three hundred feet in height, and in places is almost perpendicular. We believed the Major to be lying crushed and mangled on the rocks. Imagine our frenzy of Joy when we saw the daring soldier and his horse dash out of the bushes that skirt the base of the cliff, cross the creek, and come galloping to the fort in safety.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was wonderful! Wonderful!\\\" exclaimed Isaac, his eyes glistening. \\\"No wonder the Indians call you the 'Flying Chief.'\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1640148383,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"Do you remember him?
