"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Not their law, but the superstitious interpretation of their leaders which neither the Maccabees nor our blessed Savior did ever approve of.\\n\\n(22) In reading this and the remaining sections of this book, and some parts of the next, one may easily perceive that our usually cool and candid author, Josephus, was too highly offended with the impudent calumnies of Manethe, and the other bitter enemies of the Jews, with whom he had now to deal, and was thereby betrayed into a greater heat and passion than ordinary, and that by consequence he does not hear reason with his usual fairness and impartiality; he seems to depart sometimes from the brevity and sincerity of a faithful historian, which is his grand character, and indulges the prolixity and colors of a pleader and a disputant: accordingly, I confess, I always read these sections with less pleasure than I do the rest of his writings, though I fully believe the reproaches cast on the Jews, which he here endeavors to confute and expose, were wholly groundless and unreasonable.\\n\\n(23) This is a very valuable testimony of Manetho, that the laws of Osarsiph, or Moses, were not made in compliance with, but in opposition to, the customs of the Egyptians.

In the former book, most honored Epaphroditus, I have   demonstrated our antiquity, and confirmed the truth of what   I have said, from the writings of the Phoenicians, and   Chaldeans, and Egyptians. I have, moreover, produced many   of the Grecian writers as witnesses thereto. I have also made   a refutation of Manetho and Cheremon, and of certain others   of our enemies. I shall now (1) therefore begin a confutation   of the remaining authors who have written any thing against   us; although I confess I have had a doubt upon me about   Apion (2) the grammarian, whether I ought to take the   trouble of confuting him or not; for some of his writings   contain much the same accusations which the others have laid   against us, some things that he hath added are very frigid and   contemptible, and for the greatest part of what he says, it is   very scurrilous, and, to speak no more than the plain truth, it   shows him to be a very unlearned person, and what he lays   together looks like the work of a man of very bad morals,   and of one no better in his whole life than a mountebank.   Yet, because there are a great many men so very foolish, that   they are rather caught by such orations than by what is   written with care, and take pleasure in reproaching other   men, and cannot abide to hear them commended, I thought   it to be necessary not to let this man go off without   examination, who had written such an accusation against us,   as if he would bring us to make an answer in open court. For   I also have observed, that many men are very much delighted   when they see a man who first began to reproach another, to   be himself exposed to contempt on account of the vices he   hath himself been guilty of. However, it is not a very easy   thing to go over this man's discourse, nor to know plainly   what he means; yet does he seem, amidst a great confusion   and disorder in his falsehoods, to produce, in the first place,   such things as resemble what we have examined already, and   relate to the departure of our forefathers out of Egypt; and,   in the second place, he accuses those Jews that are   inhabitants of Alexandria; as, in the third place, he mixes   with those things such accusations as concern the sacred   purifications, with the other legal rites used in the temple.      2. Now although I cannot but think that I have already   demonstrated, and that abundantly more than was necessary,   that our fathers were not originally Egyptians, nor were   thence expelled, either on account of bodily diseases, or any   other calamities of that sort; yet will I briefly take notice of   what Apion adds upon that subject; for in his third book,   which relates to the affairs of Egypt, he speaks thus: \\\"I have   heard of the ancient men of Egypt, that Moses was of   Heliopolis, and that he thought himself obliged to follow the   customs of his forefathers, and offered his prayers in the   open air, towards the city walls; but that he reduced them all   to be directed towards sun-rising, which was agreeable to the   situation of Heliopolis; that he also set up pillars instead of   gnomons, (3) under which was represented a cavity like that   of a boat, and the shadow that fell from their tops fell down   upon that cavity, that it might go round about the like course   as the sun itself goes round in the other.\\\" This is that   wonderful relation which we have given us by this   grammarian. But that it is a false one is so plain, that it   stands in need of few words to prove it, but is manifest from   the works of Moses; for when he erected the first tabernacle   to God, he did himself neither give order for any such kind   of representation to be made at it, nor ordain that those that   came after him should make such a one. Moreover, when in   a future age Solomon built his temple in Jerusalem, he   avoided all such needless decorations as Apion hath here   devised. He says further, how he had \\\"heard of the ancient   men, that Moses was of Hellopolis.\\\" To be sure that was,   because being a younger man himself, he believed those that   by their elder age were acquainted and conversed with him.   Now this grammarian, as he was, could not certainly tell   which was the poet Homer's country, no more than he could   which was the country of Pythagoras, who lived comparatively   but a little while ago; yet does he thus easily determine the   age of Moses, who preceded them such a vast number of   years, as depending on his ancient men's relation, which   shows how notorious a liar he was. But then as to this   chronological determination of the time when he says he   brought the leprous people, the blind, and the lame out of   Egypt, see how well this most accurate grammarian of ours   agrees with those that have written before him! Manetho says   that the Jews departed out of Egypt, in the reign of   Tethmosis, three hundred ninety-three years before Danaus   fled to Argos; Lysimaehus says it was under king Bocchoris,   that is, one thousand seven hundred years ago; Molo and   some others determined it as every one pleased: but this   Apion of ours, as deserving to be believed before them, hath   determined it exactly to have been in the seventh olympiad,   and the first year of that olympiad; the very same year in   which he says that Carthage was built by the Phoenicians.   The reason why he added this building of Carthage was, to   be sure, in order, as he thought, to strengthen his assertion   by so evident a character of chronology. But he was not   aware that this character confutes his assertion; for if we may   give credit to the Phoenician records as to the time of the   first coming of their colony to Carthage, they relate that   Hirom their king was above a hundred and fifty years earlier   than the building of Carthage; concerning whom I have   formerly produced testimonials out of those Phoenician   records, as also that this Hirom was a friend of Solomon   when he was building the temple of Jerusalem, and gave him   great assistance in his building that temple; while still   Solomon himself built that temple six hundred and twelve   years after the Jews came out of Egypt. As for the number of   those that were expelled out of Egypt, he hath contrived to   have the very same number with Lysimaehus, and says they   were a hundred and ten thousand. He then assigns a certain   wonderful and plausible occasion for the name of Sabbath;   for he says that \\\"when the Jews had traveled a six days'   journey, they had buboes in their groins; and that on this   account it was that they rested on the seventh day, as having   got safely to that country which is now called Judea; that then   they preserved the language of the Egyptians, and called that   day the Sabbath, for that malady of buboes on their groin   was named Sabbatosis by the Egyptians.\\\" And would not a   man now laugh at this fellow's trifling, or rather hate his   impudence in writing thus? We must, it seems, fake it for   granted that all these hundred and ten thousand men must   have these buboes. But, for certain, if those men had been   blind and lame, and had all sorts of distempers upon them, as   Apion says they had, they could not have gone one single   day's journey; but if they had been all able to travel over a   large desert, and, besides that, to fight and conquer those   that opposed them, they had not all of them had buboes on   their groins after the sixth day was over; for no such   distemper comes naturally and of necessity upon those that   travel; but still, when there are many ten thousands in a camp   together, they constantly march a settled space \\\\[in a day\\\\].   Nor is it at all probable that such a thing should happen by   chance; this would be prodigiously absurd to be supposed.   However, our admirable author Apion hath before told us   that \\\"they came to Judea in six days' time;\\\" and again, that   \\\"Moses went up to a mountain that lay between Egypt and   Arabia, which was called Sinai, and was concealed there forty   days, and that when he came down from thence he gave laws   to the Jews.\\\" But, then, how was it possible for them to tarry   forty days in a desert place where there was no water, and at   the same time to pass all over the country between that and   Judea in the six days? And as for this grammatical translation   of the word Sabbath, it either contains an instance of his   great impudence or gross ignorance; for the words Sabbo and   Sabbath are widely different from one another; for the word   Sabbath in the Jewish language denotes rest from all sorts of   work; but the word Sabbo, as he affirms, denotes among the   Egyptians the malady of a bubo in the groin.      3. This is that novel account which the Egyptian Apion gives   us concerning the Jews' departure out of Egypt, and is no   better than a contrivance of his own. But why should we   wonder at the lies he tells about our forefathers, when he   affirms them to be of Egyptian original, when he lies also   about himself? for although he was born at Oasis in Egypt,   he pretends to be, as a man may say, the top man of all the   Egyptians; yet does he forswear his real country and   progenitors, and by falsely pretending to be born at   Alexandria, cannot deny the (4) pravity of his family; for you   see how justly he calls those Egyptians whom he hates, and   endeavors to reproach; for had he not deemed Egyptians to   be a name of great reproach, he would not have avoided the   name of an Egyptian himself; as we know that those who   brag of their own countries value themselves upon the   denomination they acquire thereby, and reprove such as   unjustly lay claim thereto. As for the Egyptians' claim to be   of our kindred, they do it on one of the following accounts; I   mean, either as they value themselves upon it, and pretend to   bear that relation to us; or else as they would draw us in to   be partakers of their own infamy. But this fine fellow Apion   seems to broach this reproachful appellation against us, \\\\[that   we were originally Egyptians,\\\\] in order to bestow it on the   Alexandrians, as a reward for the privilege they had given   him of being a fellow citizen with them: he also is apprized of   the ill-will the Alexandrians bear to those Jews who are their   fellow citizens, and so proposes to himself to reproach them,   although he must thereby include all the other Egyptians   also; while in both cases he is no better than an impudent   liar.      4. But let us now see what those heavy and wicked crimes are   which Apion charges upon the Alexandrian Jews. \\\"They came   (says he) out of Syria, and inhabited near the tempestuous   sea, and were in the neighborhood of the dashing of the   waves.\\\" Now if the place of habitation includes any thing that   is reproached, this man reproaches not his own real country,   \\\\[Egypt,\\\\] but what he pretends to be his own country,   Alexandria; for all are agreed in this, that the part of that city   which is near the sea is the best part of all for habitation.   Now if the Jews gained that part of the city by force, and   have kept it hitherto without impeachment, this is a mark of   their valor; but in reality it was Alexander himself that gave   them that place for their habitation, when they obtained   equal privileges there with the Macedonians. Nor call I devise   what Apion would have said, had their habitation been at   Necropolis? and not been fixed hard by the royal palace \\\\[as it   is\\\\]; nor had their nation had the denomination of   Macedonians given them till this very day \\\\[as they have\\\\]. Had   this man now read the epistles of king Alexander, or those of   Ptolemy the son of Lagus, or met with the writings of the   succeeding kings, or that pillar which is still standing at   Alexandria, and contains the privileges which the great   \\\\[Julius\\\\] Caesar bestowed upon the Jews; had this man, I say,   known these records, and yet hath the impudence to write in   contradiction to them, he hath shown himself to be a wicked   man; but if he knew nothing of these records, he hath shown   himself to be a man very ignorant: nay, when lie appears to   wonder how Jews could be called Alexandrians, this is   another like instance of his ignorance; for all such as are   called out to be colonies, although they be ever so far remote   from one another in their original, receive their names from   those that bring them to their new habitations. And what   occasion is there to speak of others, when those of us Jews   that dwell at Antioch are named Antiochians, because   Seleucns the founder of that city gave them the privileges   belonging thereto? After the like manner do those Jews that   inhabit Ephesus, and the other cities of Ionia, enjoy the same   name with those that were originally born there, by the grant   of the succeeding princes; nay, the kindness and humanity of   the Romans hath been so great, that it hath granted leave to   almost all others to take the same name of Romans upon   them; I mean not particular men only, but entire and large   nations themselves also; for those anciently named Iberi, and   Tyrrheni, and Sabini, are now called Romani. And if Apion   reject this way of obtaining the privilege of a citizen of   Alexandria, let him abstain from calling himself an   Alexandrian hereafter; for otherwise, how can he who was   born in the very heart of Egypt be an Alexandrian, if this way   of accepting such a privilege, of which he would have us   deprived, be once abrogated? although indeed these Romans,   who are now the lords of the habitable earth, have forbidden   the Egyptians to have the privileges of any city whatsoever;   while this fine fellow, who is willing to partake of such a   privilege himself as he is forbidden to make use of, endeavors   by calumnies to deprive those of it that have justly received   it; for Alexander did not therefore get some of our nation to   Alexandria, because he wanted inhabitants for this his city, on   whose building he had bestowed so much pains; but this was   given to our people as a reward, because he had, upon a   careful trial, found them all to have been men of virtue and   fidelity to him; for, as Hecateus says concerning us,   \\\"Alexander honored our nation to such a degree, that, for the   equity and the fidelity which the Jews exhibited to him, he   permitted them to hold the country of Samaria free from   tribute. Of the same mind also was Ptolemy the son of Lagus,   as to those Jews who dwelt at Alexandria.\\\" For he intrusted   the fortresses of Egypt into their hands, as believing they   would keep them faithfully and valiantly for him; and when   he was desirous to secure the government of Cyrene, and the   other cities of Libya, to himself, he sent a party of Jews to   inhabit in them. And for his successor Ptolemy, who was   called Philadelphus, he did not only set all those of our   nation free who were captives under him, but did frequently   give money \\\\[for their ransom\\\\]; and, what was his greatest   work of all, he had a great desire of knowing our laws, and of   obtaining the books of our sacred Scriptures; accordingly, he   desired that such men might be sent him as might interpret   our law to him; and, in order to have them well compiled, he   committed that care to no ordinary persons, but ordained   that Demetrius Phalereus, and Andreas, and Aristeas; the   first, Demetrius, the most learned person of his age, and the   others, such as were intrusted with the guard of his body;   should take care of this matter: nor would he certainly have   been so desirous of learning our law, and the philosophy of   our nation, had he despised the men that made use of it, or   had he not indeed had them in great admiration.      5. Now this Apion was unacquainted with almost all the kings   of those Macedonians whom he pretends to have been his   progenitors, who were yet very well affected towards us; for   the third of those Ptolemies, who was called Euergetes, when   he had gotten possession of all Syria by force, did not offer   his thank-offerings to the Egyptian gods for his victory, but   came to Jerusalem, and according to our own laws offered   many sacrifices to God, and dedicated to him such gifts as   were suitable to such a victory: and as for Ptolemy   Philometer and his wife Cleopatra, they committed their   whole kingdom to the Jews, when Onias and Dositheus, both   Jews, whose names are laughed at by Apion, were the   generals of their whole army. But certainly, instead of   reproaching them, he ought to admire their actions, and   return them thanks for saving Alexandria, whose citizen he   pretends to be; for when these Alexandrians were making war   with Cleopatra the queen, and were in danger of being   utterly ruined, these Jews brought them to terms of   agreement, and freed them from the miseries of a civil war.   \\\"But then (says Apion) Onias brought a small army afterward   upon the city at the time when Thorruns the Roman   ambassador was there present.\\\" Yes, do I venture to say, and   that he did rightly and very justly in so doing; for that   Ptolemy who was called Physco, upon the death of his   brother Philometer, came from Cyrene, and would have   ejected Cleopatra as well as her sons out of their kingdom,   that he might obtain it for himself unjustly. (5) For this cause   then it was that Onias undertook a war against him on   Cleopatra's account; nor would he desert that trust the royal   family had reposed in him in their distress. Accordingly, God   gave a remarkable attestation to his righteous procedure; for   when Ptolemy Physco (6) had the presumption to fight   against Onias's army, and had caught all the Jews that were   in the city \\\\[Alexandria\\\\], with their children and wives, and   exposed them naked and in bonds to his elephants, that they   might be trodden upon and destroyed, and when he had   made those elephants drunk for that purpose, the event   proved contrary to his preparations; for these elephants left   the Jews who were exposed to them, and fell violently upon   Physco's friends, and slew a great number of them; nay, after   this Ptolemy saw a terrible ghost, which prohibited his hurting   those men; his very concubine, whom he loved so well, (some   call her Ithaca, and others Irene,) making supplication to   him, that he would not perpetrate so great a wickedness. So   he complied with her request, and repented of what he either   had already done, or was about to do; whence it is well   known that the Alexandrian Jews do with good reason   celebrate this day, on the account that they had thereon been   vouchsafed such an evident deliverance from God. However,   Apion, the common calumniator of men, hath the   presumption to accuse the Jews for making this war against   Physco, when he ought to have commended them for the   same. This man also makes mention of Cleopatra, the last   queen of Alexandria, and abuses us, because she was   ungrateful to us; whereas he ought to have reproved her, who   indulged herself in all kinds of injustice and wicked practices,   both with regard to her nearest relations and husbands who   had loved her, and, indeed, in general with regard to all the   Romans, and those emperors that were her benefactors; who   also had her sister Arsinoe slain in a temple, when she had   done her no harm: moreover, she had her brother slain by   private treachery, and she destroyed the gods of her country   and the sepulchers of her progenitors; and while she had   received her kingdom from the first Caesar, she had the   impudence to rebel against his son: (7) and successor; nay,   she corrupted Antony with her love-tricks, and rendered him   an enemy to his country, and made him treacherous to his   friends, and \\\\[by his means\\\\] despoiled some of their royal   authority, and forced others in her madness to act wickedly.   But what need I enlarge upon this head any further, when   she left Antony in his fight at sea, though he were her   husband, and the father of their common children, and   compelled him to resign up his government, with the army,   and to follow her \\\\[into Egypt\\\\]? nay, when last of all Caesar   had taken Alexandria, she came to that pitch of cruelty, that   she declared she had some hope of preserving her affairs still,   in case she could kill the Jews, though it were with her own   hand; to such a degree of barbarity and perfidiousness had   she arrived. And doth any one think that we cannot boast   ourselves of any thing, if, as Apion says, this queen did not at   a time of famine distribute wheat among us? However, she at   length met with the punishment she deserved. As for us Jews,   we appeal to the great Caesar what assistance we brought   him, and what fidelity we showed to him against the   Egyptians; as also to the senate and its decrees, and the   epistles of Augustus Caesar, whereby our merits \\\\[to the   Romans\\\\] are justified. Apion ought to have looked upon   those epistles, and in particular to have examined the   testimonies given on our behalf, under Alexander and all the   Ptolemies, and the decrees of the senate and of the greatest   Roman emperors. And if Germanicus was not able to make a   distribution of corn to all the inhabitants of Alexandria, that   only shows what a barren time it was, and how great a want   there was then of corn, but tends nothing to the accusation of   the Jews; for what all the emperors have thought of the   Alexandrian Jews is well known, for this distribution of wheat   was no otherwise omitted with regard to the Jews, than it was   with regard to the other inhabitants of Alexandria. But they   still were desirous to preserve what the kings had formerly   intrusted to their care, I mean the custody of the river; nor   did those kings think them unworthy of having the entire   custody thereof, upon all occasions.      6. But besides this, Apion objects to us thus: \\\"If the Jews   (says he) be citizens of Alexandria, why do they not worship   the same gods with the Alexandrians?\\\" To which I give this   answer: Since you are yourselves Egyptians, why do you fight   it out one against another, and have implacable wars about   your religion? At this rate we must not call you all Egyptians,   nor indeed in general men, because you breed up with great   care beasts of a nature quite contrary to that of men,   although the nature of all men seems to be one and the   same. Now if there be such differences in opinion among you   Egyptians, why are you surprised that those who came to   Alexandria from another country, and had original laws of   their own before, should persevere in the observance of those   laws? But still he charges us with being the authors of   sedition; which accusation, if it be a just one, why is it not   laid against us all, since we are known to be all of one mind.   Moreover, those that search into such matters will soon   discover that the authors of sedition have been such citizens   of Alexandria as Apion is; for while they were the Grecians   and Macedonians who were ill possession of this city, there   was no sedition raised against us, and we were permitted to   observe our ancient solemnities; but when the number of the   Egyptians therein came to be considerable, the times grew   confused, and then these seditions brake out still more and   more, while our people continued uncorrupted. These   Egyptians, therefore, were the authors of these troubles, who   having not the constancy of Macedonians, nor the prudence   of Grecians, indulged all of them the evil manners of the   Egyptians, and continued their ancient hatred against us; for   what is here so presumptuously charged upon us, is owing to   the differences that are amongst themselves; while many of   them have not obtained the privileges of citizens in proper   times, but style those who are well known to have had that   privilege extended to them all no other than foreigners: for it   does not appear that any of the kings have ever formerly   bestowed those privileges of citizens upon Egyptians, no more   than have the emperors done it more lately; while it was   Alexander who introduced us into this city at first, the kings   augmented our privileges therein, and the Romans have been   pleased to preserve them always inviolable. Moreover, Apion   would lay a blot upon us, because we do not erect images for   our emperors; as if those emperors did not know this before,   or stood in need of Apion as their defender; whereas he   ought rather to have admired the magnanimity and modesty   of the Romans, whereby they do not compel those that are   subject to them to transgress the laws of their countries, but   are willing to receive the honors due to them after such a   manner as those who are to pay them esteem consistent with   piety and with their own laws; for they do not thank people   for conferring honors upon them, When they are compelled   by violence so to do. Accordingly, since the Grecians and   some other nations think it a right thing to make images, nay,   when they have painted the pictures of their parents, and   wives, and children, they exult for joy; and some there are   who take pictures for themselves of such persons as were no   way related to them; nay, some take the pictures of such   servants as they were fond of; what wonder is it then if such   as these appear willing to pay the same respect to their   princes and lords? But then our legislator hath forbidden us   to make images, not by way of denunciation beforehand, that   the Roman authority was not to be honored, but as despising   a thing that was neither necessary nor useful for either God   or man; and he forbade them, as we shall prove hereafter, to   make these images for any part of the animal creation, and   much less for God himself, who is no part of such animal   creation. Yet hath our legislator no where forbidden us to   pay honors to worthy men, provided they be of another kind,   and inferior to those we pay to God; with which honors we   willingly testify our respect to our emperors, and to the   people of Rome; we also offer perpetual sacrifices for them;   nor do we only offer them every day at the common expenses   of all the Jews, but although we offer no other such sacrifices   out of our common expenses, no, not for our own children,   yet do we this as a peculiar honor to the emperors, and to   them alone, while we do the same to no other person   whomsoever. And let this suffice for an answer in general to   Apion, as to what he says with relation to the Alexandrian   Jews.      7. However, I cannot but admire those other authors who   furnished this man with such his materials; I mean   Possidonius and Apollonius \\\\[the son of\\\\] Molo, (8) who, while   they accuse us for not worshipping the same gods whom   others worship, they think themselves not guilty of impiety   when they tell lies of us, and frame absurd and reproachful   stories about our temple; whereas it is a most shameful thing   for freemen to forge lies on any occasion, and much more so   to forge them about our temple, which was so famous over   all the world, and was preserved so sacred by us; for Apion   hath the impudence to pretend that\\\" the Jews placed an ass's   head in their holy place;\\\" and he affirms that this was   discovered when Antiochus Epiphanes spoiled our temple,   and found that ass's head there made of gold, and worth a   great deal of money. To this my first answer shall be this,   that had there been any such thing among us, an Egyptian   ought by no means to have thrown it in our teeth, since an   ass is not a more contemptible animal than   (9) and goats,   and other such creatures, which among them are gods. But   besides this answer, I say further, how comes it about that   Apion does not understand this to be no other than a   palpable lie, and to be confuted by the thing itself as utterly   incredible? For we Jews are always governed by the same   laws, in which we constantly persevere; and although many   misfortunes have befallen our city, as the like have befallen   others, and although Theos \\\\[Epiphanes\\\\], and Pompey the   Great, and Licinius Crassus, and last of all Titus Caesar, have   conquered us in war, and gotten possession of our temple;   yet have they none of them found any such thing there, nor   indeed any thing but what was agreeable to the strictest piety;   although what they found we are not at liberty to reveal to   other nations. But for Antiochus \\\\[Epiphanes\\\\], he had no just   cause for that ravage in our temple that he made; he only   came to it when he wanted money, without declaring himself   our enemy, and attacked us while we were his associates and   his friends; nor did he find any thing there that was   ridiculous. This is attested by many worthy writers; Polybius   of Megalopolis, Strabo of Cappadocia, Nicolaus of Damascus,   Timagenes, Castor the chronotoger, and Apollodorus; (10)   who all say that it was out of Antiochus's want of money that   he broke his league with the Jews, and despoiled their temple   when it was full of gold and silver. Apion ought to have had   a regard to these facts, unless he had himself had either an   ass's heart or a dog's impudence; of such a dog I mean as   they worship; for he had no other external reason for the lies   he tells of us. As for us Jews, we ascribe no honor or power   to asses, as do the Egyptians to crocodiles and asps, when   they esteem such as are seized upon by the former, or bitten   by the latter, to be happy persons, and persons worthy of   God. Asses are the same with us which they are with other   wise men, viz. creatures that bear the burdens that we lay   upon them; but if they come to our thrashing-floors and eat   our corn, or do not perform what we impose upon them, we   beat them with a great many stripes, because it is their   business to minister to us in our husbandry affairs. But this   Apion of ours was either perfectly unskillful in the   composition of such fallacious discourses, or however, when   he begun \\\\[somewhat better\\\\], he was not able to persevere in   what he had undertaken, since he hath no manner of success   in those reproaches he casts upon us.      8. He adds another Grecian fable, in order to reproach us. In   reply to which, it would be enough to say, that they who   presume to speak about Divine worship ought not to be   ignorant of this plain truth, that it is a degree of less impurity   to pass through temples, than to forge wicked calumnies of   its priests. Now such men as he are more zealous to justify a   sacrilegious king, than to write what is just and what is true   about us, and about our temple; for when they are desirous   of gratifying Antiochus, and of concealing that perfidiousness   and sacrilege which he was guilty of, with regard to our   nation, when he wanted money, they endeavor to disgrace us,   and tell lies even relating to futurities. Apion becomes other   men's prophet upon this occasion, and says that \\\"Antiochus   found in our temple a bed, and a man lying upon it, with a   small table before him, full of dainties, from the \\\\[fishes of   the\\\\] sea, and the fowls of the dry land; that this man was   amazed at these dainties thus set before him; that he   immediately adored the king, upon his coming in, as hoping   that he would afford him all possible assistance; that he fell   down upon his knees, and stretched out to him his right   hand, and begged to be released; and that when the king bid   him sit down, and tell him who he was, and why he dwelt   there, and what was the meaning of those various sorts of   food that were set before him the man made a lamentable   complaint, and with sighs, and tears in his eyes, gave him this   account of the distress he was in; and said that he was a   Greek and that as he went over this province, in order to get   his living, he was seized upon by foreigners, on a sudden, and   brought to this temple, and shut up therein, and was seen by   nobody, but was fattened by these curious provisions thus set   before him; and that truly at the first such unexpected   advantages seemed to him matter of great joy; that after a   while, they brought a suspicion him, and at length   astonishment, what their meaning should be; that at last he   inquired of the servants that came to him and was by them   informed that it was in order to the fulfilling a law of the   Jews, which they must not tell him, that he was thus fed; and   that they did the same at a set time every year: that they used   to catch a Greek foreigner, and fat him thus up every year,   and then lead him to a certain wood, and kill him, and   sacrifice with their accustomed solemnities, and taste of his   entrails, and take an oath upon this sacrificing a Greek, that   they would ever be at enmity with the Greeks; and that then   they threw the remaining parts of the miserable wretch into a   certain pit.\\\" Apion adds further, that\\\" the man said there   were but a few days to come ere he was to be slain, and   implored of Antiochus that, out of the reverence he bore to   the Grecian gods, he would disappoint the snares the Jews   laid for his blood, and would deliver him from the miseries   with which he was encompassed.\\\" Now this is such a most   tragical fable as is full of nothing but cruelty and impudence;   yet does it not excuse Antiochus of his sacrilegious attempt,   as those who write it in his vindication are willing to suppose;   for he could not presume beforehand that he should meet   with any such thing in coming to the temple, but must have   found it unexpectedly. He was therefore still an impious   person, that was given to unlawful pleasures, and had no   regard to God in his actions. But \\\\[as for Apion\\\\], he hath   done whatever his extravagant love of lying hath dictated to   him, as it is most easy to discover by a consideration of his   writings; for the difference of our laws is known not to regard   the Grecians only, but they are principally opposite to the   Egyptians, and to some other nations also for while it so falls   out that men of all countries come sometimes and sojourn   among us, how comes it about that we take an oath, and   conspire only against the Grecians, and that by the effusion   of their blood also? Or how is it possible that all the Jews   should get together to these sacrifices, and the entrails of one   man should be sufficient for so many thousands to taste of   them, as Apion pretends? Or why did not the king carry this   man, whosoever he was, and whatsoever was his name,   (which is not set down in Apion's book,) with great pomp   back into his own country? when he might thereby have been   esteemed a religious person himself, and a mighty lover of   the Greeks, and might thereby have procured himself great   assistance from all men against that hatred the Jews bore to   him. But I leave this matter; for the proper way of confuting   fools is not to use bare words, but to appeal to the things   themselves that make against them. Now, then, all such as   ever saw the construction of our temple, of what nature it   was, know well enough how the purity of it was never to be   profaned; for it had four several courts (12) encompassed   with cloisters round about, every one of which had by our law   a peculiar degree of separation from the rest. Into the first   court every body was allowed to go, even foreigners, and   none but women, during their courses, were prohibited to   pass through it; all the Jews went into the second court, as   well as their wives, when they were free from all uncleanness;   into the third court went in the Jewish men, when they were   clean and purified; into the fourth went the priests, having on   their sacerdotal garments; but for the most sacred place,   none went in but the high priests, clothed in their peculiar   garments. Now there is so great caution used about these   offices of religion, that the priests are appointed to go into   the temple but at certain hours; for in the morning, at the   opening of the inner temple, those that are to officiate   receive the sacrifices, as they do again at noon, till the doors   are shut. Lastly, it is not so much as lawful to carry any vessel   into the holy house; nor is there any thing therein, but the   altar \\\\[of incense\\\\], the table \\\\[of shew-bread\\\\], the censer, and   the candlestick, which are all written in the law; for there is   nothing further there, nor are there any mysteries performed   that may not be spoken of; nor is there any feasting within   the place. For what I have now said is publicly known, and   supported by the testimony of the whole people, and their   operations are very manifest; for although there be four   courses of the priests, and every one of them have above five   thousand men in them, yet do they officiate on certain days   only; and when those days are over, other priests succeed in   the performance of their sacrifices, and assemble together at   mid-day, and receive the keys of the temple, and the vessels   by tale, without any thing relating to food or drink being   carried into the temple; nay, we are not allowed to offer such   things at the altar, excepting what is prepared for the   sacrifices.      9. What then can we say of Apion, but that he examined   nothing that concerned these things, while still he uttered   incredible words about them? but it is a great shame for a   grammarian not to be able to write true history. Now if he   knew the purity of our temple, he hath entirely omitted to   take notice of it; but he forges a story about the seizing of a   Grecian, about ineffable food, and the most delicious   preparation of dainties; and pretends that strangers could go   into a place whereinto the noblest men among the Jews are   not allowed to enter, unless they be priests. This, therefore, is   the utmost degree of impiety, and a voluntary lie, in order to   the delusion of those who will not examine into the truth of   matters; whereas such unspeakable mischiefs as are above   related have been occasioned by such calumnies that are   raised upon us.      10. Nay, this miracle or piety derides us further, and adds the   following pretended facts to his former fable; for be says that   this man related how, \\\"while the Jews were once in a long   war with the Idumeans, there came a man out of one of the   cities of the Idumeans, who there had worshipped Apollo.   This man, whose name is said to have been Zabidus, came to   the Jews, and promised that he would deliver Apollo, the god   of Dora, into their hands, and that he would come to our   temple, if they would all come up with him, and bring the   whole multitude of the Jews with them; that Zabidus made   him a certain wooden instrument, and put it round about   him, and set three rows of lamps therein, and walked after   such a manner, that he appeared to those that stood a great   way off him to be a kind of star, walking upon the earth; that   the Jews were terribly affrighted at so surprising an   appearance, and stood very quiet at a distance; and that   Zabidus, while they continued so very quiet, went into the   holy house, and carried off that golden head of an ass, (for so   facetiously does he write,) and then went his way back again   to Dora in great haste.\\\" And say you so, sir! as I may reply;   then does Apion load the ass, that is, himself, and lays on   him a burden of fooleries and lies; for he writes of places   that have no being, and not knowing the cities he speaks of,   he changes their situation; for Idumea borders upon our   country, and is near to Gaza, in which there is no such city as   Dora; although there be, it is true, a city named Dora in   Phoenicia, near Mount Carmel, but it is four days' journey   from Idumea. (12) Now, then, why does this man accuse us,   because we have not gods in common with other nations, if   our fathers were so easily prevailed upon to have Apollo   come to them, and thought they saw him walking upon the   earth, and the stars with him? for certainly those who have so   many festivals, wherein they light lamps, must yet, at this   rate, have never seen a candlestick! But still it seems that   while Zabidus took his journey over the country, where were   so many ten thousands of people, nobody met him. He also,   it seems, even in a time of war, found the walls of Jerusalem   destitute of guards. I omit the rest. Now the doors of the holy   house were seventy (13) cubits high, and twenty cubits broad;   they were all plated over with gold, and almost of solid gold   itself, and there were no fewer than twenty (14) men required   to shut them every day; nor was it lawful ever to leave them   open, though it seems this lamp-bearer of ours opened them   easily, or thought he opened them, as he thought he had the   ass's head in his hand. Whether, therefore, he returned it to   us again, or whether Apion took it, and brought it into the   temple again, that Antiochus might find it, and afford a   handle for a second fable of Apion's, is uncertain.      11. Apion also tells a false story, when he mentions an oath   of ours, as if we \\\"swore by God, the Maker of the heaven,   and earth, and sea, to bear no good will to any foreigner, and   particularly to none of the Greeks.\\\" Now this liar ought to   have said directly that\\\" we would bear no good-will to any   foreigner, and particularly to none of the Egyptians.\\\" For   then his story about the oath would have squared with the   rest of his original forgeries, in case our forefathers had been   driven away by their kinsmen, the Egyptians, not on account   of any wickedness they had been guilty of, but on account of   the calamities they were under; for as to the Grecians, we   were rather remote from them in place, than different from   them in our institutions, insomuch that we have no enmity   with them, nor any jealousy of them. On the contrary, it hath   so happened that many of them have come over to our laws,   and some of them have continued in their observation,   although others of them had not courage enough to   persevere, and so departed from them again; nor did any   body ever hear this oath sworn by us: Apion, it seems, was   the only person that heard it, for he indeed was the first   composer of it.      12. However, Apion deserves to be admired for his great   prudence, as to what I am going to say, which is this,\\\" That   there is a plain mark among us, that we neither have just   laws, nor worship God as we ought to do, because we are not   governors, but are rather in subjection to Gentiles, sometimes   to one nation, and sometimes to another; and that our city   hath been liable to several calamities, while their city   \\\\[Alexandria\\\\] hath been of old time an imperial city, and not   used to be in subjection to the Romans.\\\" But now this man   had better leave off this bragging, for every body but himself   would think that Apion said what he hath said against   himself; for there are very few nations that have had the   good fortune to continue many generations in the   principality, but still the mutations in human affairs have put   them into subjection under others; and most nations have   been often subdued, and brought into subjection by others.   Now for the Egyptians, perhaps they are the only nation that   have had this extraordinary privilege, to have never served   any of those monarchs who subdued Asia and Europe, and   this on account, as they pretend, that the gods fled into their   country, and saved themselves by being changed into the   shapes of wild beasts! Whereas these Egyptians (15) are the   very people that appear to have never, in all the past ages,   had one day of freedom, no, not so much as from their own   lords. For I will not reproach them with relating the manner   how the Persians used them, and this not once only, but   many times, when they laid their cities waste, demolished   their temples, and cut the throats of those animals whom   they esteemed to be gods; for it is not reasonable to imitate   the clownish ignorance of Apion, who hath no regard to the   misfortunes of the Athenians, or of the Lacedemonians, the   latter of whom were styled by all men the most courageous,   and the former the most religious of the Grecians. I say   nothing of such kings as have been famous for piety,   particularly of one of them, whose name was Cresus, nor   what calamities he met with in his life; I say nothing of the   citadel of Athens, of the temple at Ephesus, of that at   Delphi, nor of ten thousand others which have been burnt   down, while nobody cast reproaches on those that were the   sufferers, but on those that were the actors therein. But now   we have met with Apion, an accuser of our nation, though   one that still forgets the miseries of his own people, the   Egptians; but it is that Sesostris who was once so celebrated a   king of Egypt that hath blinded him. Now we will not brag of   our kings, David and Solomon, though they conquered many   nations; accordingly we will let them alone. However, Apion   is ignorant of what every body knows, that the Egyptians   were servants to the Persians, and afterwards to the   Macedonians, when they were lords of Asia, and were no   better than slaves, while we have enjoyed liberty formerly;   nay, more than that, have had the dominion of the cities that   lie round about us, and this nearly for a hundred and twenty   years together, until Pompeius Magnus. And when all the   kings every where were conquered by the Romans, our   ancestors were the only people who continued to be   esteemed their confederates and friends, on account of their   fidelity to them.(16)      13. \\\"But,\\\" says Apion, \\\"we Jews have not had any wonderful   men amongst us, not any inventors of arts, nor any eminent   for wisdom.\\\" He then enumerates Socrates, and Zeno, and   Cleanthes, and some others of the same sort; and, after all,   he adds himself to them, which is the most wonderful thing   of all that he says, and pronounces Alexandria to be happy,   because it hath such a citizen as he is in it; for he was the   fittest man to be a witness to his own deserts, although he   hath appeared to all others no better than a wicked   mountebank, of a corrupt life and ill discourses; on which   account one may justly pity Alexandria, if it should value   itself upon such a citizen as he is. But as to our own men, we   have had those who have been as deserving of commendation   as any other whosoever, and such as have perused our   Antiquities cannot be ignorant of them.      14. As to the other things which he sets down as   blameworthy, it may perhaps be the best way to let them pass   without apology, that he may be allowed to be his own   accuser, and the accuser of the rest of the Egyptians.   However, he accuses us for sacrificing animals, and for   abstaining from swine's flesh, and laughs at us for the   circumcision of our privy members. Now as for our slaughter   of tame animals for sacrifices, it is common to us and to all   other men; but this Apion, by making it a crime to sacrifice   them, demonstrates himself to be an Egyptian; for had he   been either a Grecian or a Macedonian, \\\\[as he pretends to   be,\\\\] he had not shown any uneasiness at it; for those people   glory in sacrificing whole hecatombs to the gods, and make   use of those sacrifices for feasting; and yet is not the world   thereby rendered destitute of cattle, as Apion was afraid   would come to pass. Yet if all men had followed the manners   of the Egyptians, the world had certainly been made desolate   as to mankind, but had been filled full of the wildest sort of   brute beasts, which, because they suppose them to be gods,   they carefully nourish. However, if any one should ask Apion   which of the Egyptians he thinks to he the most wise and   most pious of them all, he would certainly acknowledge the   priests to be so; for the histories say that two things were   originally committed to their care by their kings' injunctions,   the worship of the gods, and the support of wisdom and   philosophy. Accordingly, these priests are all circumcised, and   abstain from swine's flesh; nor does any one of the other   Egyptians assist them in slaying those sacrifices they offer to   the gods. Apion was therefore quite blinded in his mind,   when, for the sake of the Egyptians, he contrived to reproach   us, and to accuse such others as not only make use of that   conduct of life which he so much abuses, but have also taught   other men to be circumcised, as says Herodotus; which makes   me think that Apion is hereby justly punished for his casting   such reproaches on the laws of his own country; for he was   circumcised himself of necessity, on account of an ulcer in his   privy member; and when he received no benefit by such   circumcision, but his member became putrid, he died in great   torment. Now men of good tempers ought to observe their   own laws concerning religion accurately, and to persevere   therein, but not presently to abuse the laws of other nations,   while this Apion deserted his own laws, and told lies about   ours. And this was the end of Apion's life, and this shall be   the conclusion of our discourse about him.      15. But now, since Apollonius Molo, and Lysimachus, and   some others, write treatises about our lawgiver Moses, and   about our laws, which are neither just nor true, and this   partly out of ignorance, but chiefly out of ill-will to us, while   they calumniate Moses as an impostor and deceiver, and   pretend that our laws teach us wickedness, but nothing that is   virtuous, I have a mind to discourse briefly, according to my   ability, about our whole constitution of government, and   about the particular branches of it. For I suppose it will   thence become evident, that the laws we have given us are   disposed after the best manner for the advancement of piety,   for mutual communion with one another, for a general love   of mankind, as also for justice, and for sustaining labors with   fortitude, and for a contempt of death. And I beg of those   that shall peruse this writing of mine, to read it without   partiality; for it is not my purpose to write an encomium   upon ourselves, but I shall esteem this as a most just apology   for us, and taken from those our laws, according to which we   lead our lives, against the many and the lying objections that   have been made against us. Moreover, since this Apollonius   does not do like Apion, and lay a continued accusation   against us, but does it only by starts, and up and clown his   discourse, while he sometimes reproaches us as atheists, and   man-haters, and sometimes hits us in the teeth with our want   of courage, and yet sometimes, on the contrary, accuses us of   too great boldness and madness in our conduct; nay, he says   that we are the weakest of all the barbarians, and that this is   the reason why we are the only people who have made no   improvements in human life; now I think I shall have then   sufficiently disproved all these his allegations, when it shall   appear that our laws enjoin the very reverse of what he says,   and that we very carefully observe those laws ourselves. And   if I he compelled to make mention of the laws of other   nations, that are contrary to ours, those ought deservedly to   thank themselves for it, who have pretended to depreciate   our laws in comparison of their own; nor will there, I think,   be any room after that for them to pretend either that we   have no such laws ourselves, an epitome of which I will   present to the reader, or that we do not, above all men,   continue in the observation of them.      16. To begin then a good way backward, I would advance   this, in the first place, that those who have been admirers of   good order, and of living under common laws, and who began   to introduce them, may well have this testimony that they are   better than other men, both for moderation and such virtue   as is agreeable to nature. Indeed their endeavor was to have   every thing they ordained believed to be very ancient, that   they might not be thought to imitate others, but might appear   to have delivered a regular way of living to others after them.   Since then this is the case, the excellency of a legislator is   seen in providing for the people's living after the best   manner, and in prevailing with those that are to use the laws   he ordains for them, to have a good opinion of them, and in   obliging the multitude to persevere in them, and to make no   changes in them, neither in prosperity nor adversity. Now I   venture to say, that our legislator is the most ancient of all   the legislators whom we have ally where heard of; for as for   the Lycurguses, and Solons, and Zaleucus Locrensis, and all   those legislators who are so admired by the Greeks, they   seem to be of yesterday, if compared with our legislator,   insomuch as the very name of a law was not so much as   known in old times among the Grecians. Homer is a witness   to the truth of this observation, who never uses that term in   all his poems; for indeed there was then no such thing among   them, but the multitude was governed by wise maxims, and   by the injunctions of their king. It was also a long time that   they continued in the use of these unwritten customs,   although they were always changing them upon several   occasions. But for our legislator, who was of so much greater   antiquity than the rest, (as even those that speak against us   upon all occasions do always confess,) he exhibited himself to   the people as their best governor and counselor, and included   in his legislation the entire conduct of their lives, and   prevailed with them to receive it, and brought it so to pass,   that those that were made acquainted with his laws did most   carefully observe them.      17. But let us consider his first and greatest work; for when it   was resolved on by our forefathers to leave Egypt, and return   to their own country, this Moses took the many tell   thousands that were of the people, and saved them out of   many desperate distresses, and brought them home in safety.   And certainly it was here necessary to travel over a country   without water, and full of sand, to overcome their enemies,   and, during these battles, to preserve their children, and their   wives, and their prey; on all which occasions he became an   excellent general of an army, and a most prudent counselor,   and one that took the truest care of them all; he also so   brought it about, that the whole multitude depended upon   him. And while he had them always obedient to what he   enjoined, he made no manner of use of his authority for his   own private advantage, which is the usual time when   governors gain great powers to themselves, and pave the way   for tyranny, and accustom the multitude to live very   dissolutely; whereas, when our legislator was in so great   authority, he, on the contrary, thought he ought to have   regard to piety, and to show his great good-will to the people;   and by this means he thought he might show the great degree   of virtue that was in him, and might procure the most lasting   security to those who had made him their governor. When he   had therefore come to such a good resolution, and had   performed such wonderful exploits, we had just reason to   look upon ourselves as having him for a divine governor and   counselor. And when he had first persuaded himself (17) that   his actions and designs were agreeable to God's will, he   thought it his duty to impress, above all things, that notion   upon the multitude; for those who have once believed that   God is the inspector of their lives, will not permit themselves   in any sin. And this is the character of our legislator: he was   no impostor, no deceiver, as his revilers say, though unjustly,   but such a one as they brag Minos (18) to have been among   the Greeks, and other legislators after him; for some of them   suppose that they had their laws from Jupiter, while Minos   said that the revelation of his laws was to be referred to   Apollo, and his oracle at Delphi, whether they really thought   they were so derived, or supposed, however, that they could   persuade the people easily that so it was. But which of these   it was who made the best laws, and which had the greatest   reason to believe that God was their author, it will be easy,   upon comparing those laws themselves together, to   determine; for it is time that we come to that point. (19)   Now there are innumerable differences in the particular   customs and laws that are among all mankind, which a man   may briefly reduce under the following heads: Some   legislators have permitted their governments to be under   monarchies, others put them under oligarchies, and others   under a republican form; but our legislator had no regard to   any of these forms, but he ordained our government to be   what, by a strained expression, may be termed a Theocracy,   (20) by ascribing the authority and the power to God, and by   persuading all the people to have a regard to him, as the   author of all the good things that were enjoyed either in   common by all mankind, or by each one in particular, and of   all that they themselves obtained by praying to him in their   greatest difficulties. He informed them that it was impossible   to escape God's observation, even in any of our outward   actions, or in any of our inward thoughts. Moreover, he   represented God as unbegotten, (21) and immutable, through   all eternity, superior to all mortal conceptions in pulchritude;   and, though known to us by his power, yet unknown to us as   to his essence. I do not now explain how these notions of   God are the sentiments of the wisest among the Grecians,   and how they were taught them upon the principles that he   afforded them. However, they testify, with great assurance,   that these notions are just, and agreeable to the nature of   God, and to his majesty; for Pythagoras, and Anaxagoras, and   Plato, and the Stoic philosophers that succeeded them, and   almost all the rest, are of the same sentiments, and had the   same notions of the nature of God; yet durst not these men   disclose those true notions to more than a few, because the   body of the people were prejudiced with other opinions   beforehand. But our legislator, who made his actions agree    to his laws, did not only prevail with those that were his   contemporaries to agree with these his notions, but so firmly   imprinted this faith in God upon all their posterity, that it   never could be removed. The reason why the constitution of   this legislation was ever better directed to the utility of all   than other legislations were, is this, that Moses did not make   religion a part of virtue, but he saw and he ordained other   virtues to be parts of religion; I mean justice, and fortitude,   and temperance, and a universal agreement of the members   of the community with one another; for all our actions and   studies, and all our words, \\\\[in Moses's settlement,\\\\] have a   reference to piety towards God; for he hath left none of   these in suspense, or undetermined. For there are two ways   of coining at any sort of learning and a moral conduct of life;   the one is by instruction in words, the other by practical   exercises. Now other lawgivers have separated these two ways   in their opinions, and choosing one of those ways of   instruction, or that which best pleased every one of them,   neglected the other. Thus did the Lacedemonians and the   Cretians teach by practical exercises, but not by words; while   the Athenians, and almost all the other Grecians, made laws   about what was to be done, or left undone, but had no regard   to the exercising them thereto in practice.      18. But for our legislator, he very carefully joined these two   methods of instruction together; for he neither left these   practical exercises to go on without verbal instruction, nor did   he permit the hearing of the law to proceed without the   exercises for practice; but beginning immediately from the   earliest infancy, and the appointment of every one's diet, he   left nothing of the very smallest consequence to be done at   the pleasure and disposal of the person himself. Accordingly,   he made a fixed rule of law what sorts of food they should   abstain from, and what sorts they should make use of; as also,   what communion they should have with others what great   diligence they should use in their occupations, and what times   of rest should be interposed, that, by living under that law as   under a father and a master, we might be guilty of no sin,   neither voluntary nor out of ignorance; for he did not suffer   the guilt of ignorance to go on without punishment, but   demonstrated the law to be the best and the most necessary   instruction of all others, permitting the people to leave off   their other employments, and to assemble together for the   hearing of the law, and learning it exactly, and this not once   or twice, or oftener, but every week; which thing all the other   legislators seem to have neglected.      19. And indeed the greatest part of mankind are so far from   living according to their own laws, that they hardly know   them; but when they have sinned, they learn from others that   they have transgressed the law. Those also who are in the   highest and principal posts of the government, confess they   are not acquainted with those laws, and are obliged to take   such persons for their assessors in public administrations as   profess to have skill in those laws; but for our people, if any   body do but ask any one of them about our laws, he will   more readily tell them all than he will tell his own name, and   this in consequence of our having learned them immediately   as soon as ever we became sensible of any thing, and of our   having them as it were engraven on our souls. Our   transgressors of them are but few, and it is impossible, when   any do offend, to escape punishment.      20. And this very thing it is that principally creates such a   wonderful agreement of minds amongst us all; for this entire   agreement of ours in all our notions concerning God, and our   having no difference in our course of life and manners,   procures among us the most excellent concord of these our   manners that is any where among mankind; for no other   people but the Jews have avoided all discourses about God   that any way contradict one another, which yet are frequent   among other nations; and this is true not only among   ordinary persons, according as every one is affected, but some   of the philosophers have been insolent enough to indulge   such contradictions, while some of them have undertaken to   use such words as entirely take away the nature of God, as   others of them have taken away his providence over mankind.   Nor can any one perceive amongst us any difference in the   conduct of our lives, but all our works are common to us all.   We have one sort of discourse concerning God, which is   conformable to our law, and affirms that he sees all things; as   also we have but one way of speaking concerning the conduct   of our lives, that all other things ought to have piety for their   end; and this any body may hear from our women, and   servants themselves.      21. And, indeed, hence hath arisen that accusation which   some make against us, that we have not produced men that   have been the inventors of new operations, or of new ways of   speaking; for others think it a fine thing to persevere in   nothing that has been delivered down from their forefathers,   and these testify it to be an instance of the sharpest wisdom   when these men venture to transgress those traditions;   whereas we, on the contrary, suppose it to be our only   wisdom and virtue to admit no actions nor supposals that are   contrary to our original laws; which procedure of ours is a   just and sure sign that our law is admirably constituted; for   such laws as are not thus well made are convicted upon trial   to want amendment.      22. But while we are ourselves persuaded that our law was   made agreeably to the will of God, it would be impious for us   not to observe the same; for what is there in it that any body   would change? and what can be invented that is better? or   what can we take out of other people's laws that will exceed   it? Perhaps some would have the entire settlement of our   government altered. And where shall we find a better or   more righteous constitution than ours, while this makes us   esteem God to be the Governor of the universe, and permits   the priests in general to be the administrators of the principal   affairs, and withal intrusts the government over the other   priests to the chief high priest himself? which priests our   legislator, at their first appointment, did not advance to that   dignity for their riches, or any abundance of other   possessions, or any plenty they had as the gifts of fortune; but   he intrusted the principal management of Divine worship to   those that exceeded others in an ability to persuade men, and   in prudence of conduct. These men had the main care of the   law and of the other parts of the people's conduct committed   to them; for they were the priests who were ordained to be   the inspectors of all, and the judges in doubtful cases, and the   punishers of those that were condemned to suffer   punishment.      23. What form of government then can be more holy than   this? what more worthy kind of worship can be paid to God   than we pay, where the entire body of the people are   prepared for religion, where an extraordinary degree of care   is required in the priests, and where the whole polity is so   ordered as if it were a certain religious solemnity? For what   things foreigners, when they solemnize such festivals, are not   able to observe for a few days' time, and call them Mysteries   and Sacred Ceremonies, we observe with great pleasure and   an unshaken resolution during our whole lives. What are the   things then that we are commanded or forbidden? They are   simple, and easily known. The first command is concerning   God, and affirms that God contains all things, and is a Being   every way perfect and happy, self-sufficient, and supplying all   other beings; the beginning, the middle, and the end of all   things. He is manifest in his works and benefits, and more   conspicuous than any other being whatsoever; but as to his   form and magnitude, he is most obscure. All materials, let   them be ever so costly, are unworthy to compose an image   for him, and all arts are unartful to express the notion we   ought to have of him. We can neither see nor think of any   thing like him, nor is it agreeable to piety to form a   resemblance of him. We see his works, the light, the heaven,   the earth, the sun and the moon, the waters, the generations   of animals, the productions of fruits. These things hath God   made, not with hands, nor with labor, nor as wanting the   assistance of any to cooperate with him; but as his will   resolved they should be made and be good also, they were   made and became good immediately. All men ought to follow   this Being, and to worship him in the exercise of virtue; for   this way of worship of God is the most holy of all others.      24. There ought also to be but one temple for one God; for   likeness is the constant foundation of agreement. This temple   ought to be common to all men, because he is the common   God of all men. High priests are to be continually about his   worship, over whom he that is the first by his birth is to be   their ruler perpetually. His business must be to offer   sacrifices to God, together with those priests that are joined   with him, to see that the laws be observed, to determine   controversies, and to punish those that are convicted of   injustice; while he that does not submit to him shall be   subject to the same punishment, as if he had been guilty of   impiety towards God himself. When we offer sacrifices to   him, we do it not in order to surfeit ourselves, or to be   drunken; for such excesses are against the will of God, and   would be an occasion of injuries and of luxury; but by   keeping ourselves sober, orderly, and ready for our other   occupations, and being more temperate than others. And for   our duty at the sacrifices (22) themselves, we ought, in the   first place, to pray for the common welfare of all, and after   that for our own; for we are made for fellowship one with   another, and he who prefers the common good before what is   peculiar to himself is above all acceptable to God. And let   our prayers and supplications be made humbly to God, not   \\\\[so much\\\\] that he would give us what is good, (for he hath   already given that of his own accord, and hath proposed the   same publicly to all,) as that we may duly receive it, and   when we have received it, may preserve it. Now the law has   appointed several purifications at our sacrifices, whereby we   are cleansed after a funeral, after what sometimes happens to   us in bed, and after accompanying with our wives, and upon   many other occasions, which it would be too long now to set   down. And this is our doctrine concerning God and his   worship, and is the same that the law appoints for our   practice.      25. But, then, what are our laws about marriage? That law   owns no other mixture of sexes but that which nature hath   appointed, of a man with his wife, and that this be used only   for the procreation of children. But it abhors the mixture of a   male with a male; and if any one do that, death is its   punishment. It commands us also, when we marry, not to   have regard to portion, nor to take a woman by violence, nor   to persuade her deceitfully and knavishly; but to demand her   in marriage of him who hath power to dispose of her, and is   fit to give her away by the nearness of his kindred; for, says   the Scripture, \\\"A woman is inferior to her husband in all   things.\\\" (23) Let her, therefore, be obedient to him; not so   that he should abuse her, but that she may acknowledge her   duty to her husband; for God hath given the authority to the   husband. A husband, therefore, is to lie only with his wife   whom he hath married; but to have to do with another man's   wife is a wicked thing, which, if any one ventures upon, death   is inevitably his punishment: no more can he avoid the same   who forces a virgin betrothed to another man, or entices   another man's wife. The law, moreover, enjoins us to bring   up all our offspring, and forbids women to cause abortion of   what is begotten, or to destroy it afterward; and if any woman   appears to have so done, she will be a murderer of her child,   by destroying a living creature, and diminishing human kind;   if any one, therefore, proceeds to such fornication or murder,   he cannot be clean. Moreover, the law enjoins, that after the   man and wife have lain together in a regular way, they shall   bathe themselves; for there is a defilement contracted   thereby, both in soul and body, as if they had gone into   another country; for indeed the soul, by being united to the   body, is subject to miseries, and is not freed therefrom again   but by death; on which account the law requires this   purification to be entirely performed.      26. Nay, indeed, the law does not permit us to make festivals   at the births of our children, and thereby afford occasion of   drinking to excess; but it ordains that the very beginning of   our education should be immediately directed to sobriety. It   also commands us to bring those children up in learning, and   to exercise them in the laws, and make them acquainted with   the acts of their predecessors, in order to their imitation of   them, and that they might be nourished up in the laws from   their infancy, and might neither transgress them, nor have   any pretense for their ignorance of them.      27. Our law hath also taken care of the decent burial of the   dead, but without any extravagant expenses for their funerals,   and without the erection of any illustrious monuments for   them; but hath ordered that their nearest relations should   perform their obsequies; and hath showed it to be regular,   that all who pass by when any one is buried should   accompany the funeral, and join in the lamentation. It also   ordains that the house and its inhabitants should be purified   after the funeral is over, that every one may thence learn to   keep at a great distance from the thoughts of being pure, if   he hath been once guilty of murder.      28. The law ordains also, that parents should be honored   immediately after God himself, and delivers that son who   does not requite them for the benefits he hath received from   them, but is deficient on any such occasion, to be stoned. It   also says that the young men should pay due respect to every   elder, since God is the eldest of all beings. It does not give   leave to conceal any thing from our friends, because that is   not true friendship which will not commit all things to their   fidelity: it also forbids the revelation of secrets, even though   an enmity arise between them. If any judge takes bribes, his   punishment is death: he that overlooks one that offers him a   petition, and this when he is able to relieve him, he is a guilty   person. What is not by any one intrusted to another ought   not to be required back again. No one is to touch another's   goods. He that lends money must not demand usury for its   loan. These, and many more of the like sort, are the rules   that unite us in the bands of society one with another.      29. It will be also worth our while to see what equity our   legislator would have us exercise in our intercourse with   strangers; for it will thence appear that he made the best   provision he possibly could, both that we should not dissolve   our own constitution, nor show any envious mind towards   those that would cultivate a friendship with us. Accordingly,   our legislator admits all those that have a mind to observe   our laws so to do; and this after a friendly manner, as   esteeming that a true union which not only extends to our   own stock, but to those that would live after the same   manner with us; yet does he not allow those that come to us   by accident only to be admitted into communion with us.      30. However, there are other things which our legislator   ordained for us beforehand, which of necessity we ought to   do in common to all men; as to afford fire, and water, and   food to such as want it; to show them the roads; not to let   any one lie unburied. He also would have us treat those that   are esteemed our enemies with moderation; for he doth not   allow us to set their country on fire, nor permit us to cut   down those trees that bear fruit; nay, further, he forbids us to   spoil those that have been slain in war. He hath also provided   for such as are taken captive, that they may not be injured,   and especially that the women may not be abused. Indeed he   hath taught us gentleness and humanity so effectually, that he   hath not despised the care of brute beasts, by permitting no   other than a regular use of them, and forbidding any other;   and if any of them come to our houses, like supplicants, we   are forbidden to slay them; nor may we kill the dams,   together with their young ones; but we are obliged, even in   an enemy's country, to spare and not kill those creatures that   labor for mankind. Thus hath our lawgiver contrived to teach   us an equitable conduct every way, by using us to such laws   as instruct us therein; while at the same time he hath   ordained that such as break these laws should be punished,   without the allowance of any excuse whatsoever.      31. Now the greatest part of offenses with us are capital; as if   any one be guilty of adultery; if any one force a virgin; if any   one be so impudent as to attempt sodomy with a male; or if,   upon another's making an attempt upon him, he submits to   be so used. There is also a law for slaves of the like nature,   that can never be avoided. Moreover, if any one cheats   another in measures or weights, or makes a knavish bargain   and sale, in order to cheat another; if any one steals what   belongs to another, and takes what he never deposited; all   these have punishments allotted them; not such as are met   with among other nations, but more severe ones. And as for   attempts of unjust behavior towards parents, or for impiety   against God, though they be not actually accomplished, the   offenders are destroyed immediately. However, the reward   for such as live exactly according to the laws is not silver or   gold; it is not a garland of olive branches or of small age, nor   any such public sign of commendation; but every good man   hath his own conscience bearing witness to himself, and by   virtue of our legislator's prophetic spirit, and of the firm   security God himself affords such a one, he believes that God   hath made this grant to those that observe these laws, even   though they be obliged readily to die for them, that they shall   come into being again, and at a certain revolution of things   shall receive a better life than they had enjoyed before. Nor   would I venture to write thus at this time, were it not well   known to all by our actions that many of our people have   many a time bravely resolved to endure any sufferings, rather   than speak one word against our law.      32. Nay, indeed, in case it had so fallen out, that our nation   had not been so thoroughly known among all men as they   are, and our voluntary submission to our laws had not been   so open and manifest as it is, but that somebody had   pretended to have written these laws himself, and had read   them to the Greeks, or had pretended that he had met with   men out of the limits of the known world, that had such   reverent notions of God, and had continued a long time in   the firm observance of such laws as ours, I cannot but   suppose that all men would admire them on a reflection upon   the frequent changes they had therein been themselves   subject to; and this while those that have attempted to write   somewhat of the same kind for politic government, and for   laws, are accused as composing monstrous things, and are   said to have undertaken an impossible task upon them. And   here I will say nothing of those other philosophers who have   undertaken any thing of this nature in their writings. But   even Plato himself, who is so admired by the Greeks on   account of that gravity in his manners, and force in his words,   and that ability he had to persuade men beyond all other   philosophers, is little better than laughed at and exposed to   ridicule on that account, by those that pretend to sagacity in   political affairs; although he that shall diligently peruse his   writings will find his precepts to be somewhat gentle, and   pretty near to the customs of the generality of mankind. Nay,   Plato himself confesseth that it is not safe to publish the true   notion concerning God among the ignorant multitude. Yet do   some men look upon Plato's discourses as no better than   certain idle words set off with great artifice. However, they   admire Lycurgus as the principal lawgiver, and all men   celebrate Sparta for having continued in the firm observance   of his laws for a very long time. So far then we have gained,   that it is to be confessed a mark of virtue to submit to laws.   (24) But then let such as admire this in the Lacedemonians   compare that duration of theirs with more than two thousand   years which our political government hath continued; and let   them further consider, that though the Lacedemonians did   seem to observe their laws exactly while they enjoyed their   liberty, yet that when they underwent a change of their   fortune, they forgot almost all those laws; while we, having   been under ten thousand changes in our fortune by the   changes that happened among the kings of Asia, have never   betrayed our laws under the most pressing distresses we have   been in; nor have we neglected them either out of sloth or   for a livelihood. (25) if any one will consider it, the   difficulties and labors laid upon us have been greater than   what appears to have been borne by the Lacedemonian   fortitude, while they neither ploughed their land, nor   exercised any trades, but lived in their own city, free from all   such pains-taking, in the enjoyment of plenty, and using such   exercises as might improve their bodies, while they made use   of other men as their servants for all the necessaries of life,   and had their food prepared for them by the others; and   these good and humane actions they do for no other purpose   but this, that by their actions and their sufferings they may be   able to conquer all those against whom they make war. I   need not add this, that they have not been fully able to   observe their laws; for not only a few single persons, but   multitudes of them, have in heaps neglected those laws, and   have delivered themselves, together with their arms, into the   hands of their enemies.      33. Now as for ourselves, I venture to say that no one can tell   of so many; nay, not of more than one or two that have   betrayed our laws, no, not out of fear of death itself; I do not   mean such an easy death as happens in battles, but that   which comes with bodily torments, and seems to be the   severest kind of death of all others. Now I think those that   have conquered us have put us to such deaths, not out of   their hatred to us when they had subdued us, but rather out   of their desire of seeing a surprising sight, which is this,   whether there be such men in the world who believe that no   evil is to them so great as to be compelled to do or to speak   any thing contrary to their own laws. Nor ought men to   wonder at us, if we are more courageous in dying for our   laws than all other men are; for other men do not easily   submit to the easier things in which we are instituted; I mean   working with our hands, and eating but little, and being   contented to eat and drink, not at random, or at every one's   pleasure, or being under inviolable rules in lying with our   wives, in magnificent furniture, and again in the observation   of our times of rest; while those that can use their swords in   war, and can put their enemies to flight when they attack   them, cannot bear to submit to such laws about their way of   living: whereas our being accustomed willingly to submit to   laws in these instances, renders us fit to show our fortitude   upon other occasions also.      34. Yet do the Lysimachi and the Molones, and some other   writers, (unskillful sophists as they are, and the deceivers of   young men,) reproach us as the vilest of all mankind. Now I   have no mind to make an inquiry into the laws of other   nations; for the custom of our country is to keep our own   laws, but not to bring accusations against the laws of others.   And indeed our legislator hath expressly forbidden us to   laugh at and revile those that are esteemed gods by other   people? on account of the very name of God ascribed to   them. But since our antagonists think to run us down upon   the comparison of their religion and ours, it is not possible to   keep silence here, especially while what I shall say to confute   these men will not be now first said, but hath been already   said by many, and these of the highest reputation also; for   who is there among those that have been admired among the   Greeks for wisdom, who hath not greatly blamed both the   most famous poets, and most celebrated legislators, for   spreading such notions originally among the body of the   people concerning the gods? such as these, that they may be   allowed to be as numerous as they have a mind to have them;   that they are begotten one by another, and that after all the   kinds of generation you can imagine. They also distinguish   them in their places and ways of living as they would   distinguish several sorts of animals; as some to be under the   earth; as some to be in the sea; and the ancientest of them   all to be bound in hell; and for those to whom they have   allotted heaven, they have set over them one, who in title is   their father, but in his actions a tyrant and a lord; whence it   came to pass that his wife, and brother, and daughter (which   daughter he brought forth from his own head) made a   conspiracy against him to seize upon him and confine hint, as   he had himself seized upon and confined his own father   before.      35. And justly have the wisest men thought these notions   deserved severe rebukes; they also laugh at them for   determining that we ought to believe some of the gods to be   beardless and young, and others of them to be old, and to   have beards accordingly; that some are set to trades; that one   god is a smith, and another goddess is a weaver; that one god   is a warrior, and fights with men; that some of them are   harpers, or delight in archery; and besides, that mutual   seditions arise among them, and that they quarrel about men,   and this so far, that they not only lay hands upon one   another, but that they are wounded by men, and lament, and   take on for such their afflictions. But what is the grossest of   all in point of lasciviousness, are those unbounded lusts   ascribed to almost all of them, and their amours; which how   can it be other than a most absurd supposal, especially when   it reaches to the male gods, and to the female goddesses   also? Moreover, the chief of all their gods, and their first   father himself, overlooks those goddesses whom he hath   deluded and begotten with child, and suffers them to be kept   in prison, or drowned in the sea. He is also so bound up by   fate, that he cannot save his own offspring, nor can he bear   their deaths without shedding of tears. These are fine things   indeed! as are the rest that follow. Adulteries truly are so   impudently looked on in heaven by the gods, that some of   them have confessed they envied those that were found in the   very act. And why should they not do so, when the eldest of   them, who is their king also, hath not been able to restrain   himself in the violence of his lust, from lying with his wife, so   long as they might get into their bedchamber? Now some of   the gods are servants to men, and will sometimes be builders   for a reward, and sometimes will be shepherds; while others   of them, like malefactors, are bound in a prison of brass. And   what sober person is there who would not be provoked at   such stories, and rebuke those that forged them, and   condemn the great silliness of those that admit them for   true? Nay, others there are that have advanced a certain   timorousness and fear, as also madness and fraud, and any   other of the vilest passions, into the nature and form of gods,   and have persuaded whole cities to offer sacrifices to the   better sort of them; on which account they have been   absolutely forced to esteem some gods as the givers of good   things, and to call others of them averters of evil. They also   endeavor to move them, as they would the vilest of men, by   gifts and presents, as looking for nothing else than to receive   some great mischief from them, unless they pay them such   wages.      36. Wherefore it deserves our inquiry what should be the   occasion of this unjust management, and of these scandals   about the Deity. And truly I suppose it to be derived from   the imperfect knowledge the heathen legislators had at first   of the true nature of God; nor did they explain to the people   even so far as they did comprehend of it: nor did they   compose the other parts of their political settlements   according to it, but omitted it as a thing of very little   consequence, and gave leave both to the poets to introduce   what gods they pleased, and those subject to all sorts of   passions, and to the orators to procure political decrees from   the people for the admission of such foreign gods as they   thought proper. The painters also, and statuaries of Greece,   had herein great power, as each of them could contrive a   shape \\\\[proper for a god\\\\]; the one to be formed out of clay,   and the other by making a bare picture of such a one. But   those workmen that were principally admired, had the use of   ivory and of gold as the constant materials for their new   statues \\\\[whereby it comes to pass that some temples are quite   deserted, while others are in great esteem, and adorned with   all the rites of all kinds of purification\\\\]. Besides this, the first   gods, who have long flourished in the honors done them, are   now grown old \\\\[while those that flourished after them are   come in their room as a second rank, that I may speak the   most honorably of them I can\\\\]: nay, certain other gods there   are who are newly introduced, and newly worshipped \\\\[as we,   by way of digression, have said already, and yet have left their   places of worship desolate\\\\]; and for their temples, some of   them are already left desolate, and others are built anew,   according to the pleasure of men; whereas they ought to have   their opinion about God, and that worship which is due to   him, always and immutably the same.      37. But now, this Apollonius Molo was one of these foolish   and proud men. However, nothing that I have said was   unknown to those that were real philosophers among the   Greeks, nor were they unacquainted with those frigid   pretensions of allegories \\\\[which had been alleged for such   things\\\\]; on which account they justly despised them, but have   still agreed with us as to the true and becoming notions of   God; whence it was that Plato would not have political   settlements admit to of any one of the other poets, and   dismisses even Homer himself, with a garland on his head,   and with ointment poured upon him, and this because he   should not destroy the right notions of God with his fables.   Nay, Plato principally imitated our legislator in this point,   that he enjoined his citizens to have he main regard to this   precept, \\\"That every one of them should learn their laws   accurately.\\\" He also ordained, that they should not admit of   foreigners intermixing with their own people at random; and   provided that the commonwealth should keep itself pure, and   consist of such only as persevered in their own laws.   Apollonius Molo did no way consider this, when he made it   one branch of his accusation against us, that we do not admit   of such as have different notions about God, nor will we have   fellowship with those that choose to observe a way of living   different from ourselves, yet is not this method peculiar to us,   but common to all other men; not among the ordinary   Grecians only, but among such of those Grecians as are of   the greatest reputation among them. Moreover, the   Lacedemonians continued in their way of expelling foreigners,   and would not indeed give leave to their own people to travel   abroad, as suspecting that those two things would introduce a   dissolution of their own laws: and perhaps there may be some   reason to blame the rigid severity of the Lacedemonians, for   they bestowed the privilege of their city on no foreigners, nor   indeed would give leave to them to stay among them;   whereas we, though we do not think fit to imitate other   institutions, yet do we willingly admit of those that desire to   partake of ours, which, I think, I may reckon to be a plain   indication of our humanity, and at the same time of our   magnanimity also.      38. But I shall say no more of the Lacedemonians. As for the   Athenians, who glory in having made their city to be common   to all men, what their behavior was Apollonius did not know,   while they punished those that did but speak one word   contrary to the laws about the gods, without any mercy; for   on what other account was it that Socrates was put to death   by them? For certainly he neither betrayed their city to its   enemies, nor was he guilty of any sacrilege with regard to any   of their temples; but it was on this account, that he swore   certain new oaths (26) and that he affirmed either in earnest,   or, as some say, only in jest, that a certain demon used to   make signs to him \\\\[what he should not do\\\\]. For these reasons   he was condemned to drink poison, and kill himself. His   accuser also complained that he corrupted the young men, by   inducing them to despise the political settlement and laws of   their city: and thus was Socrates, the citizen of Athens,   punished. There was also Anaxagoras, who, although he was   of Clazomente, was within a few suffrages of being   condemned to die, because he said the sun, which the   Athenians thought to be a god, was a ball of fire. They also   made this public proclamation,\\\" That they would give a talent   to any one who would kill Diagoras of Melos,\\\" because it was   reported of him that he laughed at their mysteries.   Protagoras also, who was thought to have written somewhat   that was not owned for truth by the Athenians about the   gods, had been seized upon, and put to death, if he had not   fled away immediately. Nor need we at all wonder that they   thus treated such considerable men, when they did not spare   even women also; for they very lately slew a certain priestess,   because she was accused by somebody that she initiated   people into the worship of strange gods, it having been   forbidden so to do by one of their laws; and a capital   punishment had been decreed to such as introduced a strange   god; it being manifest, that they who make use of such a law   do not believe those of other nations to be really gods,   otherwise they had not envied themselves the advantage of   more gods than they already had. And this was the happy   administration of the affairs of the Athenians! Now as to the   Scythians, they take a pleasure in killing men, and differ but   little from brute beasts; yet do they think it reasonable to   have their institutions observed. They also slew Anacharsis, a   person greatly admired for his wisdom among the Greeks,   when he returned to them, because he appeared to come   fraught with Grecian customs. One may also find many to   have been punished among the Persians, on the very same   account. And to be sure Apollonius was greatly pleased with   the laws of the Persians, and was an admirer of them,   because the Greeks enjoyed the advantage of their courage,   and had the very same opinion about the gods which they   had. This last was exemplified in the temples which they   burnt, and their courage in coming, and almost entirely   enslaving the Grecians. However, Apollonius has imitated all   the Persian institutions, and that by his offering violence to   other men's wives, and gelding his own sons. Now, with us, it   is a capital crime, if any one does thus abuse even a brute   beast; and as for us, neither hath the fear of our governors,   nor a desire of following what other nations have in so great   esteem, been able to withdraw us from our own laws; nor   have we exerted our courage in raising up wars to increase   our wealth, but only for the observation of our laws; and   when we with patience bear other losses, yet when any   persons would compel us to break our laws, then it is that we   choose to go to war, though it be beyond our ability to   pursue it, and bear the greatest calamities to the last with   much fortitude. And, indeed, what reason can there be why   we should desire to imitate the laws of other nations, while   we see they are not observed by their own legislators (27)   And why do not the Lacedemonians think of abolishing that   form of their government which suffers them not to associate   with any others, as well as their contempt of matrimony? And   why do not the Eleans and Thebans abolish that unnatural   and impudent lust, which makes them lie with males? For   they will not show a sufficient sign of their repentance of   what they of old thought to be very excellent, and very   advantageous in their practices, unless they entirely avoid all   such actions for the time to come: nay, such things are   inserted into the body of their laws, and had once such a   power among the Greeks, that they ascribed these   sodomitical practices to the gods themselves, as a part of   their good character; and indeed it was according to the same   manner that the gods married their own sisters. This the   Greeks contrived as an apology for their own absurd and   unnatural pleasures.      39. I omit to speak concerning punishments, and how many   ways of escaping them the greatest part of the legislators   have afforded malefactors, by ordaining that, for adulteries,   fines in money should be allowed, and for corrupting (28)   \\\\[virgins\\\\] they need only marry them as also what excuses they   may have in denying the facts, if any one attempts to inquire   into them; for amongst most other nations it is a studied art   how men may transgress their laws; but no such thing is   permitted amongst us; for though we be deprived of our   wealth, of our cities, or of the other advantages we have, our   law continues immortal; nor can any Jew go so far from his   own country, nor be so aftrighted at the severest lord, as not   to be more aftrighted at the law than at him. If, therefore,   this be the disposition we are under, with regard to the   excellency of our laws, let our enemies make us this   concession, that our laws are most excellent; and if still they   imagine, that though we so firmly adhere to them, yet are   they bad laws notwithstanding, what penalties then do they   deserve to undergo who do not observe their own laws, which   they esteem so far superior to them? Whereas, therefore,   length of time is esteemed to be the truest touchstone in all   cases, I would make that a testimonial of the excellency of   our laws, and of that belief thereby delivered to us   concerning God. For as there hath been a very long time for   this comparison, if any one will but compare its duration with   the duration of the laws made by other legislators, he will   find our legislator to have been the ancientest of them all.      40. We have already demonstrated that our laws have been   such as have always inspired admiration and imitation into all   other men; nay, the earliest Grecian philosophers, though in   appearance they observed the laws of their own countries, yet   did they, in their actions, and their philosophic doctrines,   follow our legislator, and instructed men to live sparingly, and   to have friendly communication one with another. Nay,   further, the multitude of mankind itself have had a great   inclination of a long time to follow our religious observances;   for there is not any city of the Grecians, nor any of the   barbarians, nor any nation whatsoever, whither our custom of   resting on the seventh day hath not come, and by which our   fasts and lighting up lamps, and many of our prohibitions as   to our food, are not observed; they also endeavor to imitate   our mutual concord with one another, and the charitable   distribution of our goods, and our diligence in our trades, and   our fortitude in undergoing the distresses we are in, on   account of our laws; and, what is here matter of the greatest   admiration, our law hath no bait of pleasure to allure men to   it, but it prevails by its own force; and as God himself   pervades all the world, so hath our law passed through all the   world also. So that if any one will but reflect on his own   country, and his own family, he will have reason to give credit   to what I say. It is therefore but just, either to condemn all   mankind of indulging a wicked disposition, when they have   been so desirous of imitating laws that are to them foreign   and evil in themselves, rather than following laws of their   own that are of a better character, or else our accusers must   leave off their spite against us. Nor are we guilty of any   envious behavior towards them, when we honor our own   legislator, and believe what he, by his prophetic authority,   hath taught us concerning God. For though we should not be   able ourselves to understand the excellency of our own laws,   yet would the great multitude of those that desire to imitate   them, justify us, in greatly valuing ourselves upon them.      41. But as for the \\\\[distinct\\\\] political laws by which we are   governed, I have delivered them accurately in my books of   Antiquities; and have only mentioned them now, so far as   was necessary to my present purpose, without proposing to   myself either to blame the laws of other nations, or to make   an encomium upon our own; but in order to convict those   that have written about us unjustly, and in an impudent   affectation of disguising the truth. And now I think I have   sufficiently completed what I proposed in writing these books.   For whereas our accusers have pretended that our nation are   a people of very late original, I have demonstrated that they   are exceeding ancient; for I have produced as witnesses   thereto many ancient writers, who have made mention of us   in their books, while they had said that no such writer had so   done. Moreover, they had said that we were sprung from the   Egyptians, while I have proved that we came from another   country into Egypt: while they had told lies of us, as if we   were expelled thence on account of diseases on our bodies, it   has appeared, on the contrary, that we returned to our   country by our own choice, and with sound and strong bodies.   Those accusers reproached our legislator as a vile fellow;   whereas God in old time bare witness to his virtuous conduct;   and since that testimony of God, time itself hath been   discovered to have borne witness to the same thing.      42. As to the laws themselves, more words are unnecessary,   for they are visible in their own nature, and appear to teach   not impiety, but the truest piety in the world. They do not   make men hate one another, but encourage people to   communicate what they have to one another freely; they are   enemies to injustice, they take care of righteousness, they   banish idleness and expensive living, and instruct men to be   content with what they have, and to be laborious in their   calling; they forbid men to make war from a desire of getting   more, but make men courageous in defending the laws; they   are inexorable in punishing malefactors; they admit no   sophistry of words, but are always established by actions   themselves, which actions we ever propose as surer   demonstrations than what is contained in writing only: on   which account I am so bold as to say that we are become the   teachers of other men, in the greatest number of things, and   those of the most excellent nature only; for what is more   excellent than inviolable piety? what is more just than   submission to laws? and what is more advantageous than   mutual love and concord? and this so far that we are to be   neither divided by calamities, nor to become injurious and   seditious in prosperity; but to contemn death when we are in   war, and in peace to apply ourselves to our mechanical   occupations, or to our tillage of the ground; while we in all   things and all ways are satisfied that God is the inspector and   governor of our actions. If these precepts had either been   written at first, or more exactly kept by any others before us,   we should have owed them thanks as disciples owe to their   masters; but if it be visible that we have made use of them   more than any other men, and if we have demonstrated that   the original invention of them is our own, let the Apions, and   the Molons, with all the rest of those that delight in lies and   reproaches, stand confuted; but let this and the foregoing   book be dedicated to thee, Epaphroditus, who art so great a   lover of truth, and by thy means to those that have been in   like manner desirous to be acquainted with the affairs of our   nation.\\n\\nAPION BOOK 2 FOOTNOTES\\n\\n(1) The former part of this second book is written against the calumnies of Apion, and then, more briefly, against the like calumnies of Apollonius Molo. But after that, Josephus leaves off any more particular reply to those adversaries of the Jews, and gives us a large and excellent description and vindication of that theocracy which was settled for the Jewish nation by Moses, their great legislator.\\n\\n(2) Called by Tiberius Cymbalum Mundi, The drum of the world.\\n\\n(3) This seems to have been the first dial that had been made in Egypt, and was a little before the time that Ahaz made his \\\\[first\\\\] dial in Judea, and about anno 755, in the first year of the seventh olympiad, as we shall see presently. See 2 Kings 20:11; Isaiah 38:8.\\n\\n(4) The burial-place for dead bodies, as I suppose.\\n\\n(5) Here begins a great defect in the Greek copy; but the old Latin version fully supplies that defect.\\n\\n(6) What error is here generally believed to have been committed by our Josephus in ascribing a deliverance of the Jews to the reign of Ptolemy Physco, the seventh of those Ptolemus, which has been universally supposed to have happened under Ptolemy Philopater, the fourth of them, is no better than a gross error of the moderns, and not of Josephus, as I have fully proved in the Authentic.

See of the War, B. V. ch. 5. sect. 4.\\n\\n(14) Two hundred in the Greek, contrary to the twenty in the War, B. VII. ch, 5. sect. 3.\\n\\n(15) This notorious disgrace belonging peculiarly to the people of Egypt, ever since the times of the old prophets of the Jews, noted both sect. 4 already, and here, may be confirmed by the testimony of Isidorus, an Egyptian of Pelusium, Epist. lib. i. Ep. 489. And this is a remarkable completion of the ancient prediction of God by Ezekiel 29:14, 15, that the Egyptians should be a base kingdom, the basest of the kingdoms,\\\" and that \\\"it should not exalt itself any more above the nations.\\\"\\n\\n(16) The truth of which still further appears by the present observation of Josephus, that these Egyptians had never, in all the past ages since Sesostris, had one day of liberty, no, not so much as to have been free from despotic power under any of the monarchies to that day. And all this bas been found equally true in the latter ages, under the Romans, Saracens, Mamelukes, and Turks, from the days of Josephus till the present ago also.\\n\\n(17) This language, that Moses, \\\"persuaded himself\\\" that what he did was according to God's will, can mean no more, by Josephus's own constant notions elsewhere, than that he was \\\"firmly persuaded,\\\" that he had \\\"fully satisfied himself\\\" that so it was, viz. by the many revelations he had received from God, and the numerous miracles God had enabled him to work, as he both in these very two books against Apion, and in his Antiquities, most clearly and frequently assures us. This is further evident from several passages lower, where he affirms that Moses was no impostor nor deceiver, and where he assures that Moses's constitution of government was no other than a theocracy; and where he says they are to hope for deliverance out of their distresses by prayer to God, and that withal it was owing in part to this prophetic spirit of Moses that the Jews expected a resurrection from the dead. See almost as strange a use of the like words, \\\"to persuade God,\\\" Antiq. B. VI. ch. 5. sect. 6.\\n\\n(18) That is, Moses really was, what the heathen legislators pretended to be, under a Divine direction; nor does it yet appear that these pretensions to a supernatural conduct, either in these legislators or oracles, were mere delusions of men without any demoniacal impressions, nor that Josephus took them so to be; as the ancientest and contemporary authors did still believe them to be supernatural.\\n\\n(19) This whole very large passage is corrected by Dr. Hudson from Eusebius's citation of it, Prep. Evangel. viii. 8, which is here not a little different from the present MSS. of Josephus.\\n\\n(20) This expression itself, that \\\"Moses ordained the Jewish government to be a theocracy,\\\" may be illustrated by that parallel expression in the Antiquities, B. III. ch. 8. sect. 9, that \\\"Moses left it to God to be present at his sacrifices when he pleased; and when he pleased, to be absent.\\\" Both ways of speaking sound harsh in the ears of Jews and Christians, as do several others which Josephus uses to the heathens; but still they were not very improper in him, when he all along thought fit to accommodate himself, both in his Antiquities, and in these his books against Apion, all written for the use of the Greeks and Romans, to their notions and language, and this as far as ever truth would give him leave. Though it be very observable withal, that he never uses such expressions in his books of the War, written originally for the Jews beyond Euphrates, and in their language, in all these cases. However, Josephus directly supposes the Jewish settlement, under Moses, to be a Divine settlement, and indeed no other than a real theocracy.\\n\\n(21) These excellent accounts of the Divine attributes, and that God is not to be at all known in his essence, as also some other clear expressions about the resurrection of the dead, and the state of departed souls, etc., in this late work of Josephus, look more like the exalted notions of the Essens, or rather Ebionite Christians, than those of a mere Jew or Pharisee. The following large accounts also of the laws of Moses, seem to me to show a regard to the higher interpretations and improvements of Moses's laws, derived from Jesus Christ, than to the bare letter of them in the Old Testament, whence alone Josephus took them when he wrote his Antiquities; nor, as I think, can some of these laws, though generally excellent in their kind, be properly now found either in the copies of the Jewish Pentateuch, or in Philo, or in Josephus himself, before he became a Nazarene or Ebionite Christian; nor even all of them among the laws of catholic Christianity themselves. I desire, therefore, the learned reader to consider, whether some of these improvements or interpretations might not be peculiar to the Essens among the Jews, or rather to the Nazarenes or Ebionites among the Christians, though we have indeed but imperfect accounts of those Nazarenes or Ebionite Christians transmitted down to us at this day.\\n\\n(22) We may here observe how known a thing it was among the Jews and heathens, in this and many other instances, that sacrifices were still accompanied with prayers; whence most probably came those phrases of \\\"the sacrifice of prayer, the sacrifice of praise, the sacrifice of thanksgiving.\\\" However, those ancient forms used at sacrifices are now generally lost, to the no small damage of true religion. It is here also exceeding remarkable, that although the temple at Jerusalem was built as the only place where the whole nation of the Jews were to offer their sacrifices, yet is there no mention of the \\\"sacrifices\\\" themselves, but of \\\"prayers\\\" only, in Solomon's long and famous form of devotion at its dedication, 1 Kings 8.; 2 Chronicles 6. See also many passages cited in the Apostolical Constitutions, VII. 37, and Of the War, above, B. VII. ch. 5. sect. 6.\\n\\n(23) This text is no where in our present copies of the Old Testament.\\n\\n(24) It may not be amiss to set down here a very remarkable testimony of the great philosopher Cicero, as to the preference of \\\"laws to philosophy: - I will,\\\" says he, \\\"boldly declare my opinion, though the whole world be offended at it. I prefer this little book of the Twelve Tables alone to all the volumes of the philosophers. I find it to be not only of more weight,' but also much more useful.\\\" - Oratore.\\n\\n(25) we have observed our times of rest, and sorts of food allowed us \\\\[during our distresses\\\\].\\n\\n(26) See what those novel oaths were in Dr. Hudson's note, viz. to swear by an oak, by a goat, and by a dog, as also by a gander, as say Philostratus and others. This swearing strange oaths was also forbidden by the Tyrians, B. I. sect. 22, as Spanheim here notes.\\n\\n(27) Why Josephus here should blame some heathen legislators, when they allowed so easy a composition for simple fornication, as an obligation to marry the virgin that was corrupted, is hard to say, seeing he had himself truly informed us that it was a law of the Jews, Antiq. B. IV. ch. 8. sect. 23, as it is the law of Christianity also: see Horeb Covenant, p. 61. I am almost ready to suspect that, for, we should here read, and that corrupting wedlock, or other men's wives, is the crime for which these heathens wickedly allowed this composition in money.\\n\\n(28) Or \\\"for corrupting other men's wives the same allowance.\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/23](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/23)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639208302,\"title\":\"A glorious testimony this of the observation of the sabbath by the Jews\"},\"digest\":\"3DCeH_kpkViEj1ahkb_Ki9iOnfwrfRUigiuU8idM4PY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xeCFFC09a569272AB1413A3E9E440BC486ddb0a97\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9BhGOFiF_qqQG9Fb8tHFJLB6nH8-nSlV65GQoWqtjOA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qIgQXQGXn342U7T8QumQHo0qiMHSVlxgnZUptFJaK20\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Jo2SbZFwiy52X7Fb-zSV9cRism6HZbsNniuIrJ8H83L4kzdtzMzzYMI7x0DMEB2bSolNdF9ny55dcU1egJvSXA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc0e0d830284b4c056e60bab5b5e8659045e42689e3892b6b2791cc87b31d5a6025b9e648d93abc712c8566a2e1a50c41ce1711997eed16cbb5a9ea4e950a95ef1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9BhGOFiF_qqQG9Fb8tHFJLB6nH8-nSlV65GQoWqtjOA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qIgQXQGXn342U7T8QumQHo0qiMHSVlxgnZUptFJaK20\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"3DCeH_kpkViEj1ahkb_Ki9iOnfwrfRUigiuU8idM4PY\"}"
