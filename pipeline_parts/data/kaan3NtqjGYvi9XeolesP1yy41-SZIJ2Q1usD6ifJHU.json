"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I’m glad to remember an internet that did not feel like it was trying to drain my attention all the time. Growing up in small towns and being unschooled, the net was both a portal for seeing the world *and* contributing to it. I talked about it briefly in my last entry—[an introduction](https://jk.mirror.xyz/DkE-9_u8B9BdJYwWYSDN80ZKUpwk5fenwIaSHPP2VvA). I’ve always enjoyed building things with whatever material is around. Back then it was a hand-me-down Compaq and dialup. I didn’t have like, hand tools to build a treehouse, but a machine with a connection. Not really decision making—“I want to make sites!”—more environmental.\\n\\nSo it was disappointing to watch this thing I was so into become more and more adversarial over time. During my teens seeing big tech displace big oil felt pretty [Virilio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Virilio)-ish. The story is familiar, yeah? Not a unique experience; it’s broadly personal.\\n\\nAs someone compelled to build, this creates a lot of tension. Honestly, the difficulty in reasoning about compromise is paralyzing at times. Limits to what’s known at any given moment. Over the past few years it felt like building meant deciding to contribute to the mess, however indirectly.\\n\\n## Platform singularities\\n\\nAs the net enveloped more of life the platforms began trying to eat each other. It’s still going on. Facebook wants to become Snapchat wants to become Netflix wants to become Youtube wants to become Instagram wants to become Shopfiy wants to become Pinterest… and so on. I’m exaggerating, but it’s undeniable that platforms want to become their neighbor *before* their neighbor becomes them.\\n\\nIt seems like the pattern is a function of time. An indicator of an aging ecosystem. We remember AOL, yeah? These things that feel too big to ever go away, but they do. This isn’t really controversial. It’s how it goes.\\n\\n---\\n\\nEvery once in a while I revisit this lecture by Pinterest co-founder Evan Sharp at Columbia GSAPP, where he attended as a student. It’s one of the better (imo) schools for architecture and urbanization. Makes sense that Evan went there. *Everything* is architecture, right?\\n\\n[Evan Sharp at GSAPP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjlDWspIPvk)\\n\\nEvan is on it. The lecture is scatter-brained and cross-disciplinary, and includes phrases like “spiritual neuroticism” and “fragmented myths.” It’s *not* a tech talk, but one of culture, spirit, big glass walls and gardens (lol.) What inspires us. He’s able to better articulate a lot of the same metaphors used by those *critical* of platforms like Pinterest.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes of watching, a question always returns: How can someone with an understanding of things so dialed be responsible for… *Pinterest*?\\n\\nIf I had to guess, it’s partly about an interplay between inspiration and intuition. A sculptor or songwriter does not dictate their work. Instead they respond. It’s a following your nose and being receptive to what a work *wants* to be. It requires an extreme sensitivity and the ability to move your ego out of the way to reveal the true shape of what’s in-front of you. Evan’s interests are on point. But Pinterest is less his creation and more the sum of what Pinterest *wanted* to be at scale. The idea *wanted* to grow.\\n\\nEvan and his team were in tune with what a platform within the “web2” attention economy wanted to be, and were able to set aside their sense of idealism for what the ecosystem afforded *and* what mass utility at scale required of them.\\n\\nTo build on web2 at scale today means accepting those same defaults and a willingness to repeat history. We’ve seen how it goes. The combination of platforms eating each other and these conditions (it’s either ads or subscriptions bb) indicate it’s the end of that timeline. Donezooooo. Time for what’s next (and already underway.)\\n\\n---\\n\\nI’m having having a lot of fun working on Mirror…an understatement, actually. I’m waking up at night with ideas frequent enough that it’s getting annoying. A good problem. They don’t feel like personal revelations, but things that are floating out there, and Mirror happens to be at the right place and time to catch them.\\n\\nThat’s not to say I don’t have concerns about parts of web3. There are a lot of open questions, and it’s kept me out of the space up until recently.\\n\\nFor example, there are great things about permanent storage, and not so great things. I’m also not sure [how much energy is involved for NFTs](https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053), same as I’m not sure how much energy goes into my salad I have each afternoon, even though I eat them every day. I try to make good choices. Eating a salad is better than a daily burger in terms of cow farts and transportation. It’s not as good as sustenance farming in my yard.\\n\\nIf crypto were going to go away, it would have by now. I’m not sure if it will start to scale in the next five years, or another ten, although I have a hunch, but there seems to be something fundamental here. It’s hard to put a finger on it, in the same way that people questioned the purpose of the internet when we only had phones, books, and TVs. People back then were also able to predict issues we’re now experiencing. “So anyone, anywhere, can publish anything, and everyone can access it?” *Was it worth it?* A difficult question, and I’m unsure if it’s the right one. It feels similar to how we now see issues with web3, but instead of looking at history we’re projecting forward.\\n\\nLast question: If I were born a decade or so earlier, would I have been concerned enough about possible issues with the net that I wouldn’t have gotten involved?\\n\\n---\\n\\nSimilar to the compromise with my salad, I’ll try to use platforms making meaningful effort to address concerns. Now that I’m contributing to the creation of this stuff too, I’ll try to do the same in my work.\\n\\nGenuinely optimistic about the future, but let’s not get lazy here.\",\"timestamp\":1612656178,\"title\":\"Where it’s at\",\"publication\":\"jk\"},\"digest\":\"G0v-7GOvspOnWsyW8lkfCj6DmIR5ld2UFl3C5mg5vY4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xFf37A713c920F6e94043D10c1230e30B13F4d500\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Gef8F4hP1ykY5K1hrll0taFZjjO9faOYs8LwPrdDquw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KzndIxWrwlYqGrHLxBFO2RlVOxQK7vVdrf9wYjvzRBE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"6g-0Uiryo29y1WPK9VFTA6oc6nbJgN0oXrFW79twKH6nvcakXkcoX_mLvNXwfg7rVb3wDOd1pI23llJTmFPSRQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8371a8a223c2ac85068051217711425ba351cd2e8dbb9c243f1218c60540fea104a338635da0ee7711ec5ec5d7ae1efac9973a438529fbe7d6c2018bbf40cd0a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on jk.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Gef8F4hP1ykY5K1hrll0taFZjjO9faOYs8LwPrdDquw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KzndIxWrwlYqGrHLxBFO2RlVOxQK7vVdrf9wYjvzRBE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"G0v-7GOvspOnWsyW8lkfCj6DmIR5ld2UFl3C5mg5vY4\"}"
