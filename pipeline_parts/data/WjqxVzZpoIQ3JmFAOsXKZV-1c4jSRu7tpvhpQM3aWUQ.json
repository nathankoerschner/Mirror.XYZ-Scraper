"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"is confronted with one great difficulty which it seems incapable of overcoming, namely, that of continuity.  Modern science, with its atomic theories of matter and electricity, does, indeed, show us that the apparent continuity of material things is spurious, that all material things consist of discrete particles, and are hence measurable in numerical terms. But modern science is also obliged to postulate an ether behind these atoms, an ether which is wholly continuous, and hence transcends the domain of number.\\\\[1\\\\] It is true that, in quite recent times, a certain school of thought has argued that the ether is also atomic in constitution-- that all things, indeed, have a grained structure, even forces being made up of a large number of quantums or indivisible units of force. But this view has not gained general acceptance, and it seems to necessitate the postulation of an ether beyond the ether, filling the interspaces between its atoms, to obviate the difficulty of conceiving of action at a distance.\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] Cf.  chap.  iii., \\\"On Nature as the Embodiment of Number,\\\" of my *A Mathematical Theory of Spirit*, to which reference has already been made.\\n\\nAccording to BERGSON, life--the reality that can only be lived, not understood--is absolutely continuous (*i.e*. not amenable to numerical treatment). It is because life is absolutely continuous that we cannot, he says, understand it; for reason acts discontinuously, grasping only, so to speak, a cinematographic view of life, made up of an immense number of instantaneous glimpses. All that passes between the glimpses is lost, and so the true whole, reason can never synthesise from that which it possesses. On the other hand, one might also argue--extending, in a way, the teaching of the physical sciences of the period between the postulation of DALTON'S atomic theory and the discovery of the significance of the ether of space--that reality is essentially discontinuous, our idea that it is continuous being a mere illusion arising from the coarseness of our senses. That might provide a complete vindication of the Pythagorean view; but a better vindication, if not of that theory, at any rate of PYTHAGORAS' philosophical attitude, is forthcoming, I think, in the fact that modern mathematics has transcended the shackles of number, and has enlarged her kingdom, so as to include quantities other than numerical.  PYTHAGORAS, had he been born in these latter centuries, would surely have rejoiced in this, enlargement, whereby the continuous as well as the discontinuous is brought, if not under the rule of number, under the rule of mathematics indeed.\\n\\nPYTHAGORAS' foremost achievement in mathematics I have already mentioned. Another notable piece of work in the same department was the discovery of a method of constructing a parallelogram having a side equal to a given line, an angle equal to a given angle, and its area equal to that of a given triangle.  PYTHAGORAS is said to have celebrated this discovery by the sacrifice of a whole ox.  The problem appears in the first book of EUCLID'S *Elements of Geometry* as proposition 44. In fact, many of the propositions of EUCLID'S first, second, fourth, and sixth books were worked out by PYTHAGORAS and the Pythagoreans; but, curiously enough, they seem greatly to have neglected the geometry of the circle.\\n\\nThe symmetrical solids were regarded by PYTHAGORAS, and by the Greek thinkers after him, as of the greatest importance. To be perfectly symmetrical or regular, a solid must have an equal number of faces meeting at each of its angles, and these faces must be equal regular polygons, *i.e*. figures whose sides and angles are all equal.  PYTHAGORAS, perhaps, may be credited with the great discovery that there are only five such solids. These are as follows:--\\n\\nThe Tetrahedron, having four equilateral triangles as faces.\\n\\nThe Cube, having six squares as faces.\\n\\nThe Octahedron, having eight equilateral triangles as faces.\\n\\nThe Dodecahedron, having twelve regular pentagons (or five-sided figures) as faces.\\n\\nThe Icosahedron, having twenty equilateral triangles as faces.\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] If the reader will copy figs.  4 to 8 on cardboard or stiff paper, bend each along the dotted lines so as to form a solid, fastening together the free edges with gummed paper, he will be in possession of models of the five solids in question.\\n\\nNow, the Greeks believed the world to be composed of four elements--earth, air, fire, water,--and to the Greek mind the conclusion was inevitable\\\\[2a\\\\] that the shapes of the particles of the elements were those of the regular solids. Earth-particles were cubical, the cube being the regular solid possessed of greatest stability; fire-particles were tetrahedral, the tetrahedron being the simplest and, hence, lightest solid. Water-particles were icosahedral for exactly the reverse reason, whilst air-particles, as intermediate between the two latter, were octahedral.  The dodecahedron was, to these ancient mathematicians, the most mysterious of the solids: it was by far the most difficult to construct, the accurate drawing of the regular pentagon necessitating a rather elaborate application of PYTHAGORAS' great theorem.\\\\[1\\\\] Hence the conclusion, as PLATO put it, that \\\"this \\\\[the regular dodecahedron\\\\] the Deity employed in tracing the plan of the Universe.\\\"\\\\[2b\\\\] Hence also the high esteem in which the pentagon was held by the Pythagoreans.  By producing each side of this latter figure the five-pointed star (fig. 9), known as the pentagram, is obtained. This was adopted by the Pythagoreans as the badge of their Society, and for many ages was held as a symbol possessed of magic powers. The mediaeval magicians made use of it in their evocations, and as a talisman it was held in the highest esteem.\\n\\n\\\\[2a\\\\] *Cf*.  PLATO:  The Timaeus, SESE xxviii--xxx.\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] \\\\[1\\\\] In reference to this matter FRANKLAND remarks: \\\"In those early days the innermost secrets of nature lay in the lap of geometry, and the extraordinary inference follows that Euclid's *Elements*, which are devoted to the investigation of the regular solids, are therefore in reality and at bottom an attempt to \\\\`solve the universe.'  Euclid, in fact, made this goal of the Pythagoreans the aim of his *Elements*.\\\"--*Op. cit*., p.  35.\\n\\n\\\\[2b\\\\] *Op.  cit*., SE xxix.\\n\\nMusic played an important part in the curriculum of the Pythagorean Brotherhood, and the important discovery that the relations between the notes of musical scales can be expressed by means of numbers is a Pythagorean one.  It must have seemed to its discoverer-- as, in a sense, it indeed is--a striking confirmation of the numerical theory of the Cosmos.  The Pythagoreans held that the positions of the heavenly bodies were governed by similar numerical relations, and that in consequence their motion was productive of celestial music. This concept of \\\"the harmony of the spheres\\\" is among the most celebrated of the Pythagorean doctrines, and has found ready acceptance in many mystically-speculative minds.  \\\"Look how the floor of heaven,\\\" says Lorenzo in SHAKESPEARE'S *The Merchant of Venice*--\\n\\n\\\" . . . Look how the floor of heaven  Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:  There's not the smallest orb which thou behold's\\\"  But in his motion like an angel sings,  Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;  Such harmony is in immortal souls;  But whilst this muddy vesture of decay  Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.\\\"\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] Act v.  scene i.\\n\\nOr, as KINGSLEY writes in one of his letters, \\\"When I walk the fields I am oppressed every now and then with an innate feeling that everything I see has a meaning, if I could but understand it. And this feeling of being surrounded with truths which I cannot grasp, amounts to an indescribable awe sometimes! Everything seems to be full of God's reflex, if we could but see it. Oh! how I have prayed to have the mystery unfolded, at least hereafter. To see, if but for a moment, the whole harmony of the great system! To hear once the music which the whole universe makes as it performs His bidding!\\\"\\\\[1\\\\] In this connection may be mentioned the very significant fact that the Pythagoreans did not consider the earth, in accordance with current opinion, to be a stationary body, but believed that it and the other planets revolved about a central point, or fire, as they called it.\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] CHAREES KINGSLEY:  *His Letters and Memories of His Life*, edited by his wife (1883), p.  28.\\n\\nAs concerns PYTHAGORAS' ethical teaching, judging from the so-called *Golden Verses* attributed to him, and no doubt written by one of his disciples,\\\\[2\\\\] this would appear to be in some respects similar to that of the Stoics who came later, but free from the materialism of the Stoic doctrines.  Due regard for oneself is blended with regard for the gods and for other men, the atmosphere of the whole being at once rational and austere. One verse--\\\"Thou shalt likewise know, according to Justice, that the nature of this Universe is in all things alike\\\"\\\\[3\\\\]-- is of particular interest, as showing PYTHAGORAS' belief in that principle of analogy--that \\\"What is below is as that which is above, what is above is as that which is below\\\"--which held so dominant a sway over the minds of ancient and mediaeval philosophers, leading them--in spite, I suggest, of its fundamental truth-- into so many fantastic errors, as we shall see in future excursions. Metempsychosis was another of the Pythagorean tenets, a fact which is interesting in view of the modern revival of this doctrine. PYTHAGORAS, no doubt, derived it from the East, apparently introducing it for the first time to Western thought.\\n\\n\\\\[2\\\\] It seems probable, though not certain, that PYTHAGORAS wrote nothing himself, but taught always by the oral method.\\n\\n\\\\[3\\\\] Cf.  the remarks of HIEROCLES on this verse in his *Commentary*.\\n\\nSuch, in brief, were the outstanding doctrines of the Pythagorean Brotherhood.  Their teachings included, as we have seen, what may justly be called scientific discoveries of the first importance, as well as doctrines which, though we may feel compelled--perhaps rightly-- to regard them as fantastic now, had an immense influence on the thought of succeeding ages, especially on Greek philosophy as represented by PLATO and the Neo-Platonists, and the more speculative minds--the occult philosophers, shall I say?--of the latter mediaeval period and succeeding centuries. The Brotherhood, however, was not destined to continue its days in peace. As I have indicated, it was a philosophical, not a political, association; but naturally PYTHAGORAS philosophy included political doctrines. At any rate, the Brotherhood acquired a considerable share in the government of Croton, a fact which was greatly resented by the members of the democratic party, who feared the loss of their rights; and, urged thereto, it is said, by a rejected applicant for membership of the Order, the mob made an onslaught on the Brotherhood's place of assembly and burnt it to the ground. One account has it that PYTHAGORAS himself died in the conflagration, a sacrifice to the mad fury of the mob.  According to another account-- and we like to believe that this is the true one--he escaped to Tarentum, from which he was banished, to find an asylum in Metapontum, where he lived his last years in peace.\\n\\nThe Pythagorean Order was broken up, but the bonds of brotherhood still existed between its members.  \\\"One of them who had fallen upon sickness and poverty was kindly taken in by an innkeeper. Before dying he traced a few mysterious signs \\\\[the pentagram, no doubt\\\\] on the door of the inn and said to the host: `Do not be uneasy, one of my brothers will pay my debts.' A year afterwards, as a stranger was passing by this inn he saw the signs and said to the host:  `I am a Pythagorean; one of my brothers died here; tell me what I owe you on his account.'  \\\"\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] EDOUARD SCHURE:  *Op.  cit*., p.  174.\\n\\nIn endeavouring to estimate the worth of PYTHAGORAS' discoveries and teaching, Mr FRANKLAND writes, with reference to his achievements in geometry:  \\\"Even after making a considerable allowance for his pupils' share, the Master's geometrical work calls for much admiration\\\"; and, \\\". . . it cannot be far wrong to suppose that it was Pythagoras' wont to insist upon proofs, and so to secure that rigour which gives to mathematics its honourable position amongst the sciences.\\\"  And of his work in arithmetic, music, and astronomy, the same author writes: \\\". . . everywhere he appears to have inaugurated genuinely scientific methods, and to have laid the foundations of a high and liberal education\\\"; adding, \\\"For nearly a score of centuries, to the very close of the Middle Ages, the four Pythagorean subjects of study--arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music--were the staple educational course, and were bound together into a fourfold way of knowledge--the Quadrivium.\\\"\\\\[1\\\\] With these words of due praise, our present excursion may fittingly close.\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] *Op.  cit*., pp.  35, 37, and 38.\\n\\nIII\\n\\nMEDICINE AND MAGIC\\n\\nTHERE are few tasks at once so instructive and so fascinating as the tracing of the development of the human mind as manifested in the evolution of scientific and philosophical theories. And this is, perhaps, especially true when, as in the case of medicine, this evolution has followed paths so tortuous, intersected by so many fantastic byways, that one is not infrequently doubtful as to the true road. The history of medicine is at once the history of human wisdom and the history of human credulity and folly, and the romantic element (to use the expression in its popular acceptation) thus introduced, whilst making the subject more entertaining, by no means detracts from its importance considered psychologically.\\n\\nTo whom the honour of having first invented medicines is due is unknown, the origins of pharmacy being lost in the twilight of myth. OSIRIS and ISIS, BACCHUS, APOLLO father of the famous physician AESCULAPTUS, and CHIRON the Centaur, tutor of the latter, are among the many mythological personages who have been accredited with the invention of physic.  It is certain that the art of compounding medicines is extraordinarily ancient.  There is a papyrus in the British Museum containing medical prescriptions which was written about 1200 B.C.; and the famous EBERS papyrus, which is devoted to medical matters, is reckoned to date from about the year 1550 B.C. It is interesting to note that in the prescriptions given in this latter papyrus, as seems to have been the case throughout the history of medicine, the principle that the efficacy of a medicine is in proportion to its nastiness appears to have been the main idea.  Indeed, many old medicines contained ingredients of the most disgusting nature imaginable: a mediaeval remedy known as oil of puppies, made by cutting up two newly-born puppies and boiling them with one pound of live earthworms, may be cited as a comparatively pleasant example of the remedies (?) used in the days when all sorts of excreta were prescribed as medicines.\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] See the late Mr A. C. WOOTTON'S excellent work, *Chronicles of Pharmacy* (2 vols, 1910), to which I gladly acknowledge my indebtedness.\\n\\nPresumably the oldest theory concerning the causation of disease is that which attributes all the ills of mankind to the malignant operations of evil spirits, a theory which someone has rather fancifully suggested is not so erroneous after all, if we may be allowed to apply the term \\\"evil spirits\\\" to the microbes of modern bacteriology.  Remnants of this theory (which does-- shall I say?--conceal a transcendental truth), that is, in its original form, still survive to the present day in various superstitious customs, whose absurdity does not need emphasising: for example, the use of red flannel by old-fashioned folk with which to tie up sore throats--red having once been supposed to be a colour very angatonistic to evil spirits; so much so that at one time red cloth hung in the patient's room was much employed as a cure for smallpox!\\n\\nMedicine and magic have always been closely associated. Indeed, the greatest name in the history of pharmacy is also what is probably the greatest name in the history of magic--the reference, of course, being to PARACELSUS (1493-1541). Until PARACELSUS, partly by his vigorous invective and partly by his remarkable cures of various diseases, demolished the old school of medicine, no one dared contest the authority of GALEN (130-*circa* 205) and AVICENNA (980--1037). GALEN'S theory of disease was largely based upon that of the four humours in man--bile, blood, phlegm, and black bile,--which were regarded as related to (but not identical with) the four elements--fire, air, water, and earth,-- being supposed to have characters similar to these.  Thus, to bile, as to fire, were attributed the properties of hotness and dryness; to blood and air those of hotness and moistness; to phlegm and water those of coldness and moistness; and, finally, black bile, like earth, was said to be cold and dry.  GALEN supposed that an alteration in the due proportion of these humours gives rise to disease, though he did not consider this to be its only cause; thus, cancer, it was thought, might result from an excess of black bile, and rheumatism from an excess of phlegm. Drugs, GALEN argued, are of efficiency in the curing of disease, according as they possess one or more of these so-called fundamental properties, hotness, dryness, coldness, and moistness, whereby it was considered that an excess of any humour might be counteracted; moreover, it was further assumed that four degrees of each property exist, and that only those drugs are of use in curing a disease which contain the necessary property or properties in the degree proportionate to that in which the opposite humour or humours are in excess in the patient's system.\\n\\nPARACELSUS' views were based upon his theory (undoubtedly true in a sense) that man is a microcosm, a world in miniature.\\\\[1\\\\] Now, all things material, taught PARACELSUS, contain the three principles termed in alchemistic phraseology salt, sulphur, and mercury. This is true, therefore, of man:  the healthy body, he argued, is a sort of chemical compound in which these three principles are harmoniously blended (as in the Macrocosm) in due proportion, whilst disease is due to a preponderance of one principle, fevers, for example, being the result of an excess of sulphur (*i.e*. the fiery principle), *etc*.  PARACELSUS, although his theory was not so different from that of GALEN, whose views he denounced, was thus led to seek for CHEMICAL remedies, containing these principles in varying proportions; he was not content with medicinal herbs and minerals in their crude state, but attempted to extract their effective essences; indeed, he maintained that the preparation of new and better drugs is the chief business of chemistry.\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] See the \\\"Note on the Paracelsian Doctrine of the Microcosm\\\" below.\\n\\nThis theory of disease and of the efficacy of drugs was complicated by many fantastic additions;\\\\[1\\\\] thus there is the \\\"Archaeus,\\\" a sort of benevolent demon, supposed by PARACELSUS to look after all the unconscious functions of the bodily organism, who has to be taken into account. PARACELSUS also held the Doctrine of Signatures, according to which the medicinal value of plants and minerals is indicated by their external form, or by some sign impressed upon them by the operation of the stars. A very old example of this belief is to be found in the use of mandrake (whose roots resemble the human form) by the Hebrews and Greeks as a cure for sterility; or, to give an instance which is still accredited by some, the use of eye-bright (*Euphrasia officinalis*, L., a plant with a black pupil-like spot in its corolla) for complaints of the eyes.\\\\[2\\\\] Allied to this doctrine are such beliefs, once held, as that the lungs of foxes are good for bronchial troubles, or that the heart of a lion will endow one with courage; as CORNELIUS AGRIPPA put it, \\\"It is well known amongst physicians that brain helps the brain, and lungs the lungs.\\\"\\\\[3\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] The question of PARACELSUS' pharmacy is further complicated by the fact that this eccentric genius coined many new words (without regard to the principles of etymology) as names for his medicines, and often used the same term to stand for quite different bodies. Some of his disciples maintained that he must not always be understood in a literal sense, in which probably there is an element of truth. See, for instance, *A Golden and Blessed Casket of Nature's Marvels*, by BENEDICTUS FIGULUS (trans. by A. E. WAITE, 1893).\\n\\n\\\\[2\\\\] See Dr ALFRED C. HADDON'S *Magic and Fetishism* (1906), p.  15.\\n\\n\\\\[3\\\\] HENRY CORNELIUS AGRIPPA:  *Occult Philosophy*, bk.  i.  chap.  xv. (WHITEHEAD'S edition, Chicago, 1898, P. 72).\\n\\nIn modern times homoeopathy--according to which a drug is a cure, if administered in small doses, for that disease whose symptoms it produces, if given in large doses to a healthy person---seems to bear some resemblance to these old medical theories concerning the curing of like by like. That the system of HAHNEMANN (1755--1843), the founder of homoeopathy, is free from error could be scarcely maintained, but certain recent discoveries in connection with serum-therapy appear to indicate that the last word has not yet been said on the subject, and the formula \\\"like cures like\\\" may still have another lease of life to run.\\n\\nTo return to PARACELSUS, however.  It may be thought that his views were not so great an advance on those of GALEN; but whether or not this be the case, his union of chemistry and medicine was of immense benefit to each science, and marked a new era in pharmacy.  Even if his theories were highly fantastic, it was he who freed medicine from the shackles of traditionalism, and rendered progress in medical science possible.\\n\\nI must not conclude these brief notes without some reference to the medical theory of the medicinal efficacy of words. The EBERS papyrus already mentioned gives various formulas which must be pronounced when preparing and when administering a drug; and there is a draught used by the Eastern Jews as a cure for bronchial complaints prepared by writing certain words on a plate, washing them off with wine, and adding three grains of a citron which has been used at the Tabernacle festival. But enough for our present excursion; we must hie us back to the modern world, with its alkaloids, serums, and anti-toxins-- another day we will, perhaps, wander again down the by-paths of Medicinal Magic.\\n\\nNOTE ON THE PARACELSIAN DOCTRINE OF THE MICROCOSM\\n\\n\\\"Man's nature,\\\" writes CORNELIUS AGRIPPA, \\\"*is the most complete Image of the whole Universe*.\\\"\\\\[1\\\\] This theory, especially connected with the name of PARACELSUS, is worthy of more than passing reference; but as the consideration of it leads us from medicine to metaphysics, I have thought it preferable to deal with the subject in a note.\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] H. C. AGRIPPA:  *Occult Philosophy*, bk.  i.  chap.  xxxiii. (WHITEHEAD'S edition, p.  111).\\n\\nMan, taught the old mystical philosophers, is threefold in nature, consisting of spirit, soul, and body.  The Paracelsian mercury, sulphur, and salt were the mineral analogues of these. \\\"As to the Spirit,\\\" writes VALENTINE WEIGEL (1533--1588), a disciple of PARACELSUS, \\\"we are of God, move in God, and live in God, and are nourished of God.  Hence God is in us and we are in God; God hath put and placed Himself in us, and we are put and placed in God.  As to the Soul, we are from the Firmament and Stars, we live and move therein, and are nourished thereof. Hence the Firmament with its astralic virtues and operations is in us, and we in it.  The Firmament is put and placed in us, and we are put and placed in the Firmament.  As to the Body, we are of the elements, we move and live therein, and are nourished of them:--hence the elements are in us, and we in them. The elements, by the slime, are put and placed in us, and we are put and placed in them.\\\"\\\\[1\\\\] Or, to quote from PARACELSUS himself, in his *Hermetic Astronomy* he writes:  \\\"God took the body out of which He built up man from those things which He created from nothingness into something . . . Hence man is now a microcosm, or a little world, because he is an extract from all the stars and planets of the whole firmament, from the earth and the elements, and so he is their quintessence.... But between the macrocosm and the microcosm this difference occurs, that the form, image, species, and substance of man are diverse therefrom. In man the earth is flesh, the water is blood, fire is the heat thereof, and air is the balsam.  These properties have not been changed but only the substance of the body.  So man is man, not a world, yet made from the world, made in the likeness, not of the world, but of God.  Yet man comprises in himself all the qualities of the world.... His body is from the world, and therefore must be fed and nourished by that world from which he has sprung.... He has been taken from the earth and from the elements, and therefore, must be nourished by these.... Now, man is not only flesh and blood, but there is within the intellect which does not, like the complexion, come from the elements, but from the stars.  And the condition of the stars is this, that all the wisdom, intelligence, industry of the animal, and all the arts peculiar to man are contained in them. From the stars man has these same things, and that is called the light of Nature; in fact, it is whatever man has found by the light of Nature.... Such, then, is the condition of man, that, out of the great universe he needs both elements and stars, seeing that he himself is constituted in that way.\\\"\\\\[1b\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] VALENTINE WEIGEL:  \\\"*Astrology Theologised\\\": The Spiritual Hermeneutics of Astrology and Holy Writ*, ed.  by ANNA BONUS KINGSFORD (1886), p.  59.\\n\\n\\\\[1b\\\\] *The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of* PARACELSUS, ed.  by A. E. WAITE (1894), vol.  ii.  pp.  289-291.\\n\\nIt is not difficult to discern a certain truth in all this, making allowances for modes of thought which are not those of the present day. The Swedish philosopher SWEDENBORG (1688-1772) reaffirmed the theory in later years; but, as he points out,\\\\[2\\\\] the reason that man is a microcosm lies deeper than in the facts that his body is of the elements of this earth and is nourished thereby. According to this profound thinker, FORM, spiritually understood, is the expression of USE, the uses of things being indicated by their forms.  Now, the human form is the highest of all forms, because it subserves the highest of all uses.  Hence, both the world of matter and the world of spirit are in the human form, because there is a correspondence in use between man and the Cosmos.  We may, therefore, call man as to his body a microcosm, or little world; as to his soul a micro-uranos, or little heaven.  Or we may speak of the macrocosm, or great world, as the Grand Man, and we may say that the Soul of this Grand Man, the self-existent, substantial, and efficient cause of all things, at once immanent within yet transcending all things, is God.\",\"timestamp\":1641298238,\"title\":\"\\nThe Pythagorean doctrine of the Cosmos, in its most reasonable form, however,\"},\"digest\":\"yRJXfmgr0uVxFFcvDCv8iYPjHw0X-t5t0CXaW86pMf8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x667E6054E728f4dC76df3f0F3c9c6bf23c751e8a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"poFSYrhfsZxUAFDiQBRg4DGdnJJIsr8uXBBJL2A-OHo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gUvhYEGFIn_GrsUBpmhDM2f2RSAEsAr5AIbbzLHDLnk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Pwb6KMdF23_AAzx61jzG-3xSboO4mrguD4PBn2BQ8HzIjUx5lFxOsO5jtvggFv6NvAQb7f2Q89Lo0ZmpaIGq2Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x46aa50d5f8f0291e0840b5c2458abe3e23b3c835a5edfb143895596150edd8c2014ea257c007c815a4293807679569f1fa38905efc3c44225f052413575e5b8e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"poFSYrhfsZxUAFDiQBRg4DGdnJJIsr8uXBBJL2A-OHo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gUvhYEGFIn_GrsUBpmhDM2f2RSAEsAr5AIbbzLHDLnk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"yRJXfmgr0uVxFFcvDCv8iYPjHw0X-t5t0CXaW86pMf8\"}"
