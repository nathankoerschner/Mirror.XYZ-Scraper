"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"One of the earliest provocations at Mirror went a little like this: what if you had a great idea, and when telling the story introducing it to the world you could *also* enable the reader to participate in making that story *come to life*. What if that happened directly within the narrative as part of the story?\\n\\nThis scenario has informed our approach to interface since day one, and lead us to creating a series of *Economic Blocks*—embeddable interfaces you can place within a story enabling readers to interact by funding and sustaining great ideas. *To be active participants of the story being created.*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a6ce55c-ead2-4343-99ae-93568ffbd715.jpeg?height=1012&width=2024&hide=true)\\n\\nClearly there was something to this. We’re beginning to lose count of how many successful projects have taken place during Mirror’s first few months! Projects like Colin and Samir’s [NFT auction and split](https://colinandsamir.mirror.xyz/G5kD1SysIvVE-Socv7zknOExp3wZWZPSZ9_sxBj_cV4), Songcamp’s [auctions and splits for three original songs](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM), Emily’s [crowdfund for $NOVEL](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), and many more.\\n\\n![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/permalinks.svg?height=1012&width=2024&size=medium)\\n\\nThe economic blocks powering these projects have turned out to be just that—*very powerful.* Although they take form as focused embeddable blocks within stories, each contain much of the same functionality you’d expect from an *entire platform*. No joke!\\n\\nWith this in mind, we decided to give economic blocks permanent homes by creating **Permalinks**—direct links to URLs where blocks are accessible outside of entries. You can discover a block’s permalink by clicking the 🔗 link icon in the a block heading. Auctions in particular look good! Here are a few favorite examples:\\n\\n- COPE’s [First Issue crowdfund and split](https://cope.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0xb0c813151d18482a914a2b95b1a25d020532Bb36).\\n- SongCamp’s [auction and split for a song](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/auctions/0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3028).\\n- Visualize Value’s [split for the Infinite Players auction](https://mirror.xyz/splits/0xc811597463a2A5ec2dda2291fF3F35938dE48702).\\n- Mint Fund’s [auction and split for an entire zine](https://sirsu.mirror.xyz/auctions/0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3051)!\\n\\nIn truth, this has been on our mind since day one, but overtime the idea was validated by seeing how blocks have been used by *you*. We’re excited to continue introducing other ideas up our sleeve. It’s easy to imagine how a design system of embeddable “blocks” which represent expanded web3 “apps” may evolve in the future. *Yes, we’re thinking about THAT thing you just thought of, too* 😉\\n\\nOnwards!\",\"timestamp\":1620935196,\"title\":\"Introducing Block Permalinks\",\"publication\":\"dev\"},\"digest\":\"DaeZVckJ-rLH0hlQ6Vbab1k_tBynafzX_zqRdzXTe8g\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9651B2a7Aa9ed9635cE896a1Af1a7d6294d5e902\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"6-A0HV62AM3FiX0BIVDqhYkEcFrrKXVyrgZfX8ZuumM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AuT6MMvLaGUkwgmq9tY65E_pw5-ZcXe6raZvO-ikIAs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"yQdZEs2DWEtqvZmKdel44kqLSYLNl0P0UMnVws3ESE8Q94MiP_84P8_sUvFhbBnPNueLISjT60eiNLLzqWY4-g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x842685ad569f1b45877c913ca34ea17a4d6bbfbc2d3986849ca737f7f46459fb4eb47c2edf73b7e119e1fe86d8ea5ccc619ae4d0d3fd079f3ebe739ab40b9d9a1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on dev.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"6-A0HV62AM3FiX0BIVDqhYkEcFrrKXVyrgZfX8ZuumM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AuT6MMvLaGUkwgmq9tY65E_pw5-ZcXe6raZvO-ikIAs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DaeZVckJ-rLH0hlQ6Vbab1k_tBynafzX_zqRdzXTe8g\"}"
