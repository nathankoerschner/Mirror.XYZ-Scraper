This means we are a group of people that coordinate online in a decentralized manner and are united by a common mission. In our case, our mission is simple: **To decentralize access to space**.\\n\\n### Why should we decentralize access to space?\\n\\nWe are currently living at the inflection point of a privatized space race. The implications of this exponential takeoff is massive, and its outcomes will define our future.\\n\\nFew people comprehend the magnitude of the opportunity to go to the Moon or Mars. Going to the New World made Spain the richest country on the planet, and that was “only” discovering two continents.\\n\\nCreating an economic connection with an entirely new planet will be such a massive wealth creation opportunity that few can wrap their heads around it. Trillions and trillions of dollars. And who would benefit most from this? The people that are *already* the richest in the world: Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin, Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic.\\n\\nNow, we don’t doubt that making life multi-planetary is a bad goal, quite the opposite, **we believe that making life multi-planetary is one of the most inspiring and important missions in our lifetime**, the big question is: *how?*\\n\\n**We believe that an international, decentralized, inclusive, and transparent organization would be much better aligned with the needs of the everyday person.**\\n\\nWe’re not saying that Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos are “Dr. Evil” like characters, but at the end of the day the incentives often dictate the outcomes.\\n\\nAt MoonDAO we do not believe in \\\"Emperors of the Moon,\\\" “Kings of Mars,” or \\\"CEOs of Space,\\\" but instead **we believe in extending the unalienable rights of citizens of planet earth to the solar system and beyond, and sharing the benefits of space exploration with “the people.”**\\n\\n*So… how do we intend on going to the Moon? Hasn’t no one been there since the 70s? Also what capability do you have that well funded space companies that have been working on this for years don’t?*\\n\\n## MoonDAO’s Roadmap\\n\\n![\\\"The Crypto-Token to Moon-Colony Pipeline.\\\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gCSAGzAL_QJL2ToyOuDXP.png?height=500&width=1500)\\n\\n### 🌒 Moon Phase 1: Deploy a token for decentralized governance of MoonDAO. Goal: Raise 10 Million Dollars.\\n\\nIn order to be a DAO, we need a governance token for decision making. This is our first step. **There is no expectation of profit with this token, this token’s purpose is to coordinate our governance.**\\n\\n**The core team has not pre-mined any tokens for ourselves.** We have not partnered with any Venture Capitalists, Influencers, Angel Investors, Rich Friends or Family, or any other rich people with “special terms” on our token.\\n\\n**Every investor, big or small, has gotten the same terms. No special treatment for anyone.** This is unusual for an Ethereum project, but we thought it would be more fair for everyone involved that we did not airdrop or pre-mine any number of tokens for people ahead of time. We are not VC funded, we are community organized and led, this is very important to us!\\n\\n**What are the properties of this token?**\\n\\n1. Our token will have a fixed supply. Once our initial token raise is over, **we will never increase the supply of the tokens.**\\n2. Our token will be used for governance decisions. We will have proportional governance up to a community decided limit. The limit is needed such that if one person buys more than 51% the tokens they cannot centrally control the DAO’s decisions.\\n3. The money raised from this token will fund the workers (NFT designers, website developers, solidity developers, marketing, legal consulting, etc.) needed to complete the rest of the roadmap.\\n4. The token raise will occur on [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money), and for every contribution we will create governance tokens at a fixed rate of 1 ETH = 1,000,000 $MOON tokens. You will receive a portion of those tokens in your wallet, and then some will stay with the DAO in order to fund the work required to make this DAO function, and those tokens will form part of the shared treasury that you can vote on with your tokens.\\n\\nThere is no expectation of profit with this token. It is a governance token. You are not receiving and fractionalized ownership of the DAOs assets in exchange for the token, check our FAQs for more information and disclaimers.\\n\\n[https://moondao.com/docs/faq](https://moondao.com/docs/faq)\\n\\n### 🌓 Moon Phase 2: Send a MoonDAO member to space in 2022.\\n\\n1. We will release the *Ticket to Space* NFT collection. **These NFTs can only be bought with our token**, and will put you into a lottery to win a ticket to fly to space in 2022.\\n2. The money raised from the sale of these NFTs will be used to buy tickets to space on a SpaceX/Blue Origin/Virgin Galactic etc. rocket ship.\\n3. Send MoonDAO member(s) to space in 2022.\\n\\n**How much will this cost?** Virgin Galactic has sold tickets for $250K and it has been reported that Blue Origin’s tickets are currently up for auction for around $20M. The range is large. MoonDAO wants to help create a world where anyone can fly to space regardless of their financial situation. We hope that this can be a meaningful and inspirational first step in decentralizing space exploration.\\n\\nSo far in history, space exploration has been gated to the rest of the world — accessible to only the privileged. MoonDAO changes this for the first time in history.\\n\\n### 🌔 Moon Phase 3: Provide funding to space research and exploration.\\n\\nThe exploration of space should unify the world, not pit us against each other like the last space race. After all, aren't we all just curious earthlings that want to explore the unknown? Now, Web 3.0 represents a technology that can unify earthlings and decentralize space exploration.\\n\\n### 🌕 Moon Phase 4: Put a MoonDAO colony on the Moon.\\n\\nThat's one small step for a DAO, one giant leap for DAO-kind.\\n\\nThe 1967 Space Treaty forms the basis for all law concerning space. In this treaty it states that no *national* appropriation of the Moon can take place. However, a DAO is not a nation — it is an international collective of frens.\\n\\nWe have the opportunity to use these new governance and coordination tools in order to form a more perfect union as we extend the rights and liberties of every human on earth into the solar system.\\n\\n### 🌝 Moon Phase 5: Have sweet Moon parties (everyone's invited).\\n\\nThey're gonna be sweet. BYOB but we'll provide transportation.\\n\\n## Our Values\\n\\nWe don’t want to get on our soapbox too much, but MoonDAO has very strong values and a strong vision.\\n\\nScaling DAOs is difficult, scaling any organization is difficult. We want MoonDAO to last for year and years, and to outlive any individual member. In order to scale this DAO we abide by strong values:\\n\\n### Space should be in the hands of the people.\\n\\n**ALL** the people, with **NO special treatment** to any single group, nation, or private entity.\\n\\n**This is why we have no pre-mine, no whitelisting, no special treatment to influencers, investors, VCs, our close friends, or the founders themselves.**\\n\\nWe uphold values of inclusion, peace, transparency, freedom of organization and speech. Space should be in the hands of the people.\\n\\nMoonDAO will support funding for individuals to go to space, acquisition of collectively governed assets (like our own rockets 👀), and fund future space research and exploration as it fits into the mission of becoming the governing body for the moon and other celestial bodies.\\n\\n## Who is behind this?\\n\\nKori Rogers and myself found each other on Discord after the fallout of ConstitutionDAO. I myself was a core developer at ConstitutionDAO, but ultimately I resigned after a disagreement with some of the other core contributors. I learned a lot from my time at ConstitutionDAO and I’m taking the learnings to MoonDAO.\\n\\nWe have now built an awesome team at MoonDAO, when asked to write bios many say things like “I’m not good at self-promotion,” and I think the ethos of MoonDAO is not about making it “about” any single contributor. However, it is only human nature to be skeptical of organizations without a clear face or reputation behind it, so Kori and I have written some bios so people can get to know us -- however we do not claim to be the leaders, nor do we want any special treatment once the DAO reaches maturity. We are DAO members first, not “core contributors” or anything like that.\\n\\n### Pablo Moncada-Larrotiz​\\n\\n**Bio:** “Hey I'm Pablo, I used to work in BigTech but then I dropped out after seeing where the world could be heading with centralized control over billion's of people's lives. I see cryptographic decentralization as a key component of the solution to fixing these problems. My full-time attention is on JuntoDAO: a DAO to allow people to collectively govern their real life and digital assets with smart contacts, basically making it easier to share things with your friends. Before that I worked at Waymo (Google's self driving car), YoutubeVR (real-time server-side rendering, light-field enthusiast), and in biotech (developing a bioreactor to engineer human body parts). I mostly grew up in Ann Arbor, MI, and went to Michigan (Go Blue!), but I'm very culturally Spanish and lived in Zaragoza as a kid.”\\n\\nTwitter: [@LarrotizPablo](https://twitter.com/LarrotizPablo) || DiscordID: @pmoncada\\n\\n### Kori Rogers​\\n\\n**Bio:** “Hey all! I'm Kori- a Web 3.0 fanatic and a graduate in MEng Engineering Science at Oxford University. I'm currently a part of Y-Combinator company Filta- helping to build an NFT market-place for AR art. Before falling into the rabbit-hole, I worked at the Computational Health Informatics Lab at Oxford- designing machine learning algorithms to predict emergency events in ICUs to save lives. I'm British-Japanese and grew up in Singapore, but I've recently found myself hanging out in the States.”\\n\\nTwitter: [@korigrogers](https://twitter.com/korigrogers) || Discord ID: @kogero\\n\\nThere are awesome contributors who have done incredible work so far: Max Dana put together our website at lightning speed; “Boilerrat” has been a voice of reason, guiding big discussions with his experience in the space, and providing dank memes; and many many others that are “Moon Settlers” (enroggo, izkp, jango, nektar.c.k, 0xSTVG.eth, moguel, to name just a few) in our Discord that have helped in a million different ways and have been critical in moving this project forward. **We have made many frens along the way, and I’m sure there are many more that will join us in our mission as we go!**\\n\\n## Interested in contributing?\\n\\n**We are launching our governance token on Friday, December 17th!** We might (*wink*) commemorate early contributors.
