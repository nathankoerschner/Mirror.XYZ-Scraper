"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"He has been imitated by all succeeding writers; and it may be doubted whether from all his successors more maxims of theoretical knowledge, or more rules of practical prudence can be collected than he alone has given to his country.\\\"--Dr. SAMUEL JOHNSON.\\n\\nPREFACE\\n\\nThe writings of Shakespeare have been justly termed \\\"the richest, the purest, the fairest, that genius uninspired ever penned.\\\"\\n\\nShakespeare instructed by delighting.  His plays alone (leaving mere science out of the question), contain more actual wisdom than the whole body of English learning.  He is the teacher of all good-- pity, generosity, true courage, love.  His bright wit is cut out \\\"into little stars.\\\"  His solid masses of knowledge are meted out in morsels and proverbs, and thus distributed, there is scarcely a corner of the English-speaking world to-day which he does not illuminate, or a cottage which he does not enrich.  His bounty is like the sea, which, though often unacknowledged, is everywhere felt.  As his friend, Ben Jonson, wrote of him, \\\"He was not of an age but for all time.\\\"  He ever kept the highroad of human life whereon all travel.  He did not pick out by-paths of feeling and sentiment.  In his creations we have no moral highwaymen, sentimental thieves, interesting villains, and amiable, elegant adventuresses--no delicate entanglements of situation, in which the grossest images are presented to the mind disguised under the superficial attraction of style and sentiment.  He flattered no bad passion, disguised no vice in the garb of virtue, trifled with no just and generous principle.  While causing us to laugh at folly, and shudder at crime, he still preserves our love for our fellow-beings, and our reverence for ourselves.\\n\\nShakespeare was familiar with all beautiful forms and images, with all that is sweet or majestic in the simple aspects of nature, of that indestructible love of flowers and fragrance, and dews, and clear waters--and soft airs and sounds, and bright skies and woodland solitudes, and moon-light bowers, which are the material elements of poetry,--and with that fine sense of their indefinable relation to mental emotion, which is its essence and vivifying soul--and which, in the midst of his most busy and tragical scenes, falls like gleams of sunshine on rocks and ruins--contrasting with all that is rugged or repulsive, and reminding us of the existence of purer and brighter elements.\\n\\nThese things considered, what wonder is it that the works of Shakespeare, next to the Bible, are the most highly esteemed of all the classics of English literature.  \\\"So extensively have the characters of Shakespeare been drawn upon by artists, poets, and writers of fiction,\\\" says an American author,--\\\"So interwoven are these characters in the great body of English literature, that to be ignorant of the plot of these dramas is often a cause of embarrassment.\\\"\\n\\nBut Shakespeare wrote for grown-up people, for men and women, and in words that little folks cannot understand.\\n\\nHence this volume.  To reproduce the entertaining stories contained in the plays of Shakespeare, in a form so simple that children can understand and enjoy them, was the object had in view by the author of these Beautiful Stories from Shakespeare.\\n\\nAnd that the youngest readers may not stumble in pronouncing any unfamiliar names to be met with in the stories, the editor has prepared and included in the volume a Pronouncing Vocabulary of Difficult Names.  To which is added a collection of Shakespearean Quotations, classified in alphabetical order, illustrative of the wisdom and genius of the world's greatest dramatist.\\n\\nE. T. R.\\n\\nA BRIEF LIFE OF SHAKESPEARE.\\n\\nIn the register of baptisms of the parish church of Stratford-upon-Avon, a market town in Warwickshire, England, appears, under date of April 26, 1564, the entry of the baptism of William, the son of John Shakspeare.  The entry is in Latin--\\\"Gulielmus filius Johannis Shakspeare.\\\"\\n\\nThe date of William Shakespeare's birth has usually been taken as three days before his baptism, but there is certainly no evidence of this fact.\\n\\nThe family name was variously spelled, the dramatist himself not always spelling it in the same way.  While in the baptismal record the name is spelled \\\"Shakspeare,\\\" in several authentic autographs of the dramatist it reads \\\"Shakspere,\\\" and in the first edition of his works it is printed \\\"Shakespeare.\\\"\\n\\nHalliwell tells us, that there are not less than thirty-four ways in which the various members of the Shakespeare family wrote the name, and in the council-book of the corporation of Stratford, where it is introduced one hundred and sixty-six times during the period that the dramatist's father was a member of the municipal body, there are fourteen different spellings.  The modern \\\"Shakespeare\\\" is not among them.\\n\\nShakespeare's father, while an alderman at Stratford, appears to have been unable to write his name, but as at that time nine men out of ten were content to make their mark for a signature, the fact is not specially to his discredit.\\n\\nThe traditions and other sources of information about the occupation of Shakespeare's father differ.  He is described as a butcher, a woolstapler, and a glover, and it is not impossible that he may have been all of these simultaneously or at different times, or that if he could not properly be called any one of them, the nature of his occupation was such as to make it easy to understand how the various traditions sprang up.  He was a landed proprietor and cultivator of his own land even before his marriage, and he received with his wife, who was Mary Arden, daughter of a country gentleman, the estate of Asbies, 56 acres in extent.  William was the third child.  The two older than he were daughters, and both probably died in infancy.  After him was born three sons and a daughter. For ten or twelve years at least, after Shakespeare's birth his father continued to be in easy circumstances.  In the year 1568 he was the high bailiff or chief magistrate of Stratford, and for many years afterwards he held the position of alderman as he had done for three years before.  To the completion of his tenth year, therefore, it is natural to suppose that William Shakespeare would get the best education that Stratford could afford.  The free school of the town was open to all boys and like all the grammar-schools of that time, was under the direction of men who, as graduates of the universities, were qualified to diffuse that sound scholarship which was once the boast of England.  There is no record of Shakespeare's having been at this school, but there can be no rational doubt that he was educated there.  His father could not have procured for him a better education anywhere.  To those who have studied Shakespeare's works without being influenced by the old traditional theory that he had received a very narrow education, they abound with evidences that he must have been solidly grounded in the learning, properly so called, was taught in the grammar schools.\\n\\nThere are local associations connected with Stratford which could not be without their influence in the formation of young Shakespeare's mind.  Within the range of such a boy's curiosity were the fine old historic towns of Warwick and Coventry, the sumptuous palace of Kenilworth, the grand monastic remains of Evesham.  His own Avon abounded with spots of singular beauty, quiet hamlets, solitary woods.  Nor was Stratford shut out from the general world, as many country towns are.  It was a great highway, and dealers with every variety of merchandise resorted to its markets.  The eyes of the poet dramatist must always have been open for observation.  But nothing is known positively of Shakespeare from his birth to his marriage to Anne Hathaway in 1582, and from that date nothing but the birth of three children until we find him an actor in London about 1589.\\n\\nHow long acting continued to be Shakespeare's sole profession we have no means of knowing, but it is in the highest degree probable that very soon after arriving in London he began that work of adaptation by which he is known to have begun his literary career. To improve and alter older plays not up to the standard that was required at the time was a common practice even among the best dramatists of the day, and Shakespeare's abilities would speedily mark him out as eminently fitted for this kind of work.  When the alterations in plays originally composed by other writers became very extensive, the work of adaptation would become in reality a work of creation.  And this is exactly what we have examples of in a few of Shakespeare's early works, which are known to have been founded on older plays.\\n\\nIt is unnecessary here to extol the published works of the world's greatest dramatist.  Criticism has been exhausted upon them, and the finest minds of England, Germany, and America have devoted their powers to an elucidation of their worth.\\n\\nShakespeare died at Stratford on the 23rd of April, 1616.  His father had died before him, in 1602, and his mother in 1608.  His wife survived him till August, 1623.  His so Hamnet died in 1596 at the age of eleven years.  His two daughters survived him, the eldest of whom, Susanna, had, in 1607, married a physician of Stratford, Dr. Hall.  The only issue of this marriage, a daughter named Elizabeth, born in 1608, married first Thomas Nasbe, and afterwards Sir John Barnard, but left no children by either marriage.  Shakespeare's younger daughter, Judith, on the 10th of February, 1616, married a Stratford gentleman named Thomas Quincy, by whom she had three sons, all of whom died, however, without issue.  There are thus no direct descendants of Shakespeare.\\n\\nShakespeare's fellow-actors, fellow-dramatists, and those who knew him in other ways, agree in expressing not only admiration of his genius, but their respect and love for the man.  Ben Jonson said, \\\"I love the man, and do honor his memory, on this side idolatry, as much as any.  He was indeed honest, and of an open and free nature.\\\"  He was buried on the second day after his death, on the north side of the chancel of Stratford church.  Over his grave there is a flat stone with this inscription, said to have been written by himself:\\n\\n```\\nGood friend for Jesus sake forbeare     To digg the dust encloased heare:     Blest be ye man yt spares these stones,     And curst be he yt moves my bones.\\n```\\n\\nA MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM\\n\\nHermia and Lysander were lovers; but Hermia's father wished her to marry another man, named Demetrius.\\n\\nNow, in Athens, where they lived, there was a wicked law, by which any girl who refused to marry according to her father's wishes, might be put to death.  Hermia's father was so angry with her for refusing to do as he wished, that he actually brought her before the Duke of Athens to ask that she might be killed, if she still refused to obey him.  The Duke gave her four days to think about it, and, at the end of that time, if she still refused to marry Demetrius, she would have to die.\\n\\nLysander of course was nearly mad with grief, and the best thing to do seemed to him for Hermia to run away to his aunt's house at a place beyond the reach of that cruel law; and there he would come to her and marry her.  But before she started, she told her friend, Helena, what she was going to do.\\n\\nHelena had been Demetrius' sweetheart long before his marriage with Hermia had been thought of, and being very silly, like all jealous people, she could not see that it was not poor Hermia's fault that Demetrius wished to marry her instead of his own lady, Helena. She knew that if she told Demetrius that Hermia was going, as she was, to the wood outside Athens, he would follow her, \\\"and I can follow him, and at least I shall see him,\\\" she said to herself. So she went to him, and betrayed her friend's secret.\\n\\nNow this wood where Lysander was to meet Hermia, and where the other two had decided to follow them, was full of fairies, as most woods are, if one only had the eyes to see them, and in this wood on this night were the King and Queen of the fairies, Oberon and Titania.  Now fairies are very wise people, but now and then they can be quite as foolish as mortal folk.  Oberon and Titania, who might have been as happy as the days were long, had thrown away all their joy in a foolish quarrel.  They never met without saying disagreeable things to each other, and scolded each other so dreadfully that all their little fairy followers, for fear, would creep into acorn cups and hide them there.\\n\\nSo, instead of keeping one happy Court and dancing all night through in the moonlight as is fairies' use, the King with his attendants wandered through one part of the wood, while the Queen with hers kept state in another.  And the cause of all this trouble was a little Indian boy whom Titania had taken to be one of her followers. Oberon wanted the child to follow him and be one of his fairy knights; but the Queen would not give him up.\\n\\nOn this night, in a mossy moonlit glade, the King and Queen of the fairies met.\\n\\n\\\"Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania,\\\" said the King.\\n\\n\\\"What! jealous, Oberon?\\\" answered the Queen.  \\\"You spoil everything with your quarreling.  Come, fairies, let us leave him.  I am not friends with him now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It rests with you to make up the quarrel,\\\" said the King.\\n\\n\\\"Give me that little Indian boy, and I will again be your humble servant and suitor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Set your mind at rest,\\\" said the Queen.  \\\"Your whole fairy kingdom buys not that boy from me.  Come, fairies.\\\"\\n\\nAnd she and her train rode off down the moonbeams.\\n\\n\\\"Well, go your ways,\\\" said Oberon.  \\\"But I'll be even with you before you leave this wood.\\\"\\n\\nThen Oberon called his favorite fairy, Puck.  Puck was the spirit of mischief.  He used to slip into the dairies and take the cream away, and get into the churn so that the butter would not come, and turn the beer sour, and lead people out of their way on dark nights and then laugh at them, and tumble people's stools from under them when they were going to sit down, and upset their hot ale over their chins when they were going to drink.\\n\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said Oberon to this little sprite, \\\"fetch me the flower called Love-in-idleness.  The juice of that little purple flower laid on the eyes of those who sleep will make them, when they wake, to love the first thing they see.  I will put some of the juice of that flower on my Titania's eyes, and when she wakes she will love the first thing she sees, were it lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, or meddling monkey, or a busy ape.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Puck was gone, Demetrius passed through the glade followed by poor Helena, and still she told him how she loved him and reminded him of all his promises, and still he told her that he did not and could not love her, and that his promises were nothing. Oberon was sorry for poor Helena, and when Puck returned with the flower, he bade him follow Demetrius and put some of the juice on his eyes, so that he might love Helena when he woke and looked on her, as much as she loved him.  So Puck set off, and wandering through the wood found, not Demetrius, but Lysander, on whose eyes he put the juice; but when Lysander woke, he saw not his own Hermia, but Helena, who was walking through the wood looking for the cruel Demetrius; and directly lie saw her he loved her and left his own lady, under the spell of the purple flower.\\n\\nWhen Hermia woke she found Lysander gone, and wandered about the wood trying to find him.  Puck went back and told Oberon what lie had done, and Oberon soon found that he had made a mistake, and set about looking for Demetrius, and having found him, put some of the juice on his eyes.  And the first thing Demetrius saw when he woke was also Helena.  So now Demetrius and Lysander were both following her through the wood, and it was Hermia's turn to follow her lover as Helena had done before.  The end of it was that Helena and Hermia began to quarrel, and Demetrius and Lysander went off to fight.  Oberon was very sorry to see his kind scheme to help these lovers turn out so badly.  So he said to Puck--\\n\\n\\\"These two young men are going to fight.  You must overhang the night with drooping fog, and lead them so astray, that one will never find the other.  When they are tired out, they will fall asleep.  Then drop this other herb on Lysander's eyes.  That will give him his old sight and his old love.  Then each man will have the lady who loves him, and they will all think that this has been only a Midsummer Night's Dream.  Then when this is done, all will be well with them.\\\"\\n\\nSo Puck went and did as he was told, and when the two had fallen asleep without meeting each other, Puck poured the juice on Lysander's eyes, and said:--\\n\\n```\\n   \\\"When thou wakest,         Thou takest         True delight         In the sight         Of thy former lady's eye:         Jack shall have Jill;         Nought shall go ill.\\\"\\n```\\n\\nMeanwhile Oberon found Titania asleep on a bank where grew wild thyme, oxlips, and violets, and woodbine, musk-roses and eglantine. There Titania always slept a part of the night, wrapped in the enameled skin of a snake.  Oberon stooped over her and laid the juice on her eyes, saying:--\\n\\n```\\n   \\\"What thou seest when thou wake,         Do it for thy true love take.\\\"\\n```\\n\\nNow, it happened that when Titania woke the first thing she saw was a stupid clown, one of a party of players who had come out into the wood to rehearse their play.  This clown had met with Puck, who had clapped an ass's head on his shoulders so that it looked as if it grew there.  Directly Titania woke and saw this dreadful monster, she said, \\\"What angel is this?  Are you as wise as you are beautiful?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If I am wise enough to find my way out of this wood, that's enough for me,\\\" said the foolish clown.\\n\\n\\\"Do not desire to go out of the wood,\\\" said Titania.  The spell of the love-juice was on her, and to her the clown seemed the most beautiful and delightful creature on all the earth.  \\\"I love you,\\\" she went on.  \\\"Come with me, and I will give you fairies to attend on you.\\\"\\n\\nSo she called four fairies, whose names were Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed.\\n\\n\\\"You must attend this gentleman,\\\" said the Queen.  \\\"Feed him with apricots and dewberries, purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries. Steal honey-bags for him from the bumble-bees, and with the wings of painted butterflies fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will,\\\" said one of the fairies, and all the others said, \\\"I will.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now, sit down with me,\\\" said the Queen to the clown, \\\"and let me stroke your dear cheeks, and stick musk-roses in your smooth, sleek head, and kiss your fair large ears, my gentle joy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where's Peaseblossom?\\\" asked the clown with the ass's head.  He did not care much about the Queen's affection, but he was very proud of having fairies to wait on him.  \\\"Ready,\\\" said Peaseblossom.\\n\\n\\\"Scratch my head, Peaseblossom,\\\" said the clown.  \\\"Where's Cobweb?\\\" \\\"Ready,\\\" said Cobweb.\\n\\n\\\"Kill me,\\\" said the clown, \\\"the red bumble-bee on the top of the thistle yonder, and bring me the honey-bag.  Where's Mustardseed?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ready,\\\" said Mustardseed.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I want nothing,\\\" said the clown.  \\\"Only just help Cobweb to scratch.  I must go to the barber's, for methinks I am marvelous hairy about the face.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Would you like anything to eat?\\\" said the fairy Queen.\\n\\n\\\"I should like some good dry oats,\\\" said the clown--for his donkey's head made him desire donkey's food--\\\"and some hay to follow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Shall some of my fairies fetch you new nuts from the squirrel's house?\\\" asked the Queen.\\n\\n\\\"I'd rather have a handful or two of good dried peas,\\\" said the clown.  \\\"But please don't let any of your people disturb me; I am going to sleep.\\\"\\n\\nThen said the Queen, \\\"And I will wind thee in my arms.\\\"\\n\\nAnd so when Oberon came along he found his beautiful Queen lavishing kisses and endearments on a clown with a donkey's head.\\n\\nAnd before he released her from the enchantment, he persuaded her to give him the little Indian boy he so much desired to have. Then he took pity on her, and threw some juice of the disenchanting flower on her pretty eyes; and then in a moment she saw plainly the donkey-headed clown she had been loving, and knew how foolish she had been.\\n\\nOberon took off the ass's head from the clown, and left him to finish his sleep with his own silly head lying on the thyme and violets.\\n\\nThus all was made plain and straight again.  Oberon and Titania loved each other more than ever.  Demetrius thought of no one but Helena, and Helena had never had any thought of anyone but Demetrius.\\n\\nAs for Hermia and Lysander, they were as loving a couple as you could meet in a day's march, even through a fairy wood.\\n\\nSo the four mortal lovers went back to Athens and were married; and the fairy King and Queen live happily together in that very wood at this very day.\\n\\nTHE TEMPEST\\n\\nProspero, the Duke of Milan, was a learned and studious man, who lived among his books, leaving the management of his dukedom to his brother Antonio, in whom indeed he had complete trust.  But that trust was ill-rewarded, for Antonio wanted to wear the duke's crown himself, and, to gain his ends, would have killed his brother but for the love the people bore him.  However, with the help of Prospero's great enemy, Alonso, King of Naples, he managed to get into his hands the dukedom with all its honor, power, and riches. For they took Prospero to sea, and when they were far away from land, forced him into a little boat with no tackle, mast, or sail. In their cruelty and hatred they put his little daughter, Miranda (not yet three years old), into the boat with him, and sailed away, leaving them to their fate.\\n\\nBut one among the courtiers with Antonio was true to his rightful master, Prospero.  To save the duke from his enemies was impossible, but much could be done to remind him of a subject's love.  So this worthy lord, whose name was Gonzalo, secretly placed in the boat some fresh water, provisions, and clothes, and what Prospero valued most of all, some of his precious books.\\n\\nThe boat was cast on an island, and Prospero and his little one landed in safety.  Now this island was enchanted, and for years had lain under the spell of a fell witch, Sycorax, who had imprisoned in the trunks of trees all the good spirits she found there.  She died shortly before Prospero was cast on those shores, but the spirits, of whom Ariel was the chief, still remained in their prisons.\\n\\nProspero was a great magician, for he had devoted himself almost entirely to the study of magic during the years in which he allowed his brother to manage the affairs of Milan.  By his art he set free the imprisoned spirits, yet kept them obedient to his will, and they were more truly his subjects than his people in Milan had been.  For he treated them kindly as long as they did his bidding, and he exercised his power over them wisely and well. One creature alone he found it necessary to treat with harshness: this was Caliban, the son of the wicked old witch, a hideous, deformed monster, horrible to look on, and vicious and brutal in all his habits.\\n\\nWhen Miranda was grown up into a maiden, sweet and fair to see, it chanced that Antonio and Alonso, with Sebastian, his brother, and Ferdinand, his son, were at sea together with old Gonzalo, and their ship came near Prospero's island.  Prospero, knowing they were there, raised by his art a great storm, so that even the sailors on board gave themselves up for lost; and first among them all Prince Ferdinand leaped into the sea, and, as his father thought in his grief, was drowned.  But Ariel brought him safe ashore; and all the rest of the crew, although they were washed overboard, were landed unhurt in different parts of the island, and the good ship herself, which they all thought had been wrecked, lay at anchor in the harbor whither Ariel had brought her.  Such wonders could Prospero and his spirits perform.\\n\\nWhile yet the tempest was raging, Prospero showed his daughter the brave ship laboring in the trough of the sea, and told her that it was filled with living human beings like themselves.  She, in pity of their lives, prayed him who had raised this storm to quell it.  Then her father bade her to have no fear, for he intended to save every one of them.\\n\\nThen, for the first time, he told her the story of his life and hers, and that he had caused this storm to rise in order that his enemies, Antonio and Alonso, who were on board, might be delivered into his hands.\\n\\nWhen he had made an end of his story he charmed her into sleep, for Ariel was at hand, and he had work for him to do.  Ariel, who longed for his complete freedom, grumbled to be kept in drudgery, but on being threateningly reminded of all the sufferings he had undergone when Sycorax ruled in the land, and of the debt of gratitude he owed to the master who had made those sufferings to end, he ceased to complain, and promised faithfully to do whatever Prospero might command.\\n\\n\\\"Do so,\\\" said Prospero, \\\"and in two days I will discharge thee.\\\"\\n\\nThen he bade Ariel take the form of a water nymph and sent him in search of the young prince.  And Ariel, invisible to Ferdinand, hovered near him, singing the while--\\n\\n\\\"Come unto these yellow sands       And then take hands:     Court'sied when you have, and kiss'd       (The wild waves whist),     Foot it featly here and there;     And, sweet sprites, the burden bear!\\\"\\n\\nAnd Ferdinand followed the magic singing, as the song changed to a solemn air, and the words brought grief to his heart, and tears to his eyes, for thus they ran--\\n\\n\\\"Full fathom five thy father lies;       Of his bones are coral made.     Those are pearls that were his eyes,       Nothing of him that doth fade,     But doth suffer a sea-change     Into something rich and strange.     Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell.     Hark! now I hear them,-- ding dong bell!\\\"\\n\\nAnd so singing, Ariel led the spell-bound prince into the presence of Prospero and Miranda.  Then, behold! all happened as Prospero desired.  For Miranda, who had never, since she could first remember, seen any human being save her father, looked on the youthful prince with reverence in her eyes, and love in her secret heart.\\n\\n\\\"I might call him,\\\" she said, \\\"a thing divine, for nothing natural I ever saw so noble!\\\"\\n\\nAnd Ferdinand, beholding her beauty with wonder and delight, exclaimed--\\n\\n\\\"Most sure the goddess on whom these airs attend!\\\"\\n\\nNor did he attempt to hide the passion which she inspired in him, for scarcely had they exchanged half a dozen sentences, before he vowed to make her his queen if she were willing.  But Prospero, though secretly delighted, pretended wrath.\\n\\n\\\"You come here as a spy,\\\" he said to Ferdinand.  \\\"I will manacle your neck and feet together, and you shall feed on fresh water mussels, withered roots and husk, and have sea-water to drink. Follow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Ferdinand, and drew his sword.  But on the instant Prospero charmed him so that he stood there like a statue, still as stone; and Miranda in terror prayed her father to have mercy on her lover.  But he harshly refused her, and made Ferdinand follow him to his cell.  There he set the Prince to work, making him remove thousands of heavy logs of timber and pile them up; and Ferdinand patiently obeyed, and thought his toil all too well repaid by the sympathy of the sweet Miranda.\\n\\nShe in very pity would have helped him in his hard work, but he would not let her, yet he could not keep from her the secret of his love, and she, hearing it, rejoiced and promised to be his wife.\\n\\nThen Prospero released him from his servitude, and glad at heart, he gave his consent to their marriage.\\n\\n\\\"Take her,\\\" he said, \\\"she is thine own.\\\"\\n\\nIn the meantime, Antonio and Sebastian in another part of the island were plotting the murder of Alonso, the King of Naples, for Ferdinand being dead, as they thought, Sebastian would succeed to the throne on Alonso's death.  And they would have carried out their wicked purpose while their victim was asleep, but that Ariel woke him in good time.\\n\\nMany tricks did Ariel play them.  Once he set a banquet before them, and just as they were going to fall to, he appeared to them amid thunder and lightning in the form of a harpy, and immediately the banquet disappeared.  Then Ariel upbraided them with their sins and vanished too.\\n\\nProspero by his enchantments drew them all to the grove without his cell, where they waited, trembling and afraid, and now at last bitterly repenting them of their sins.\\n\\nProspero determined to make one last use of his magic power, \\\"And then,\\\" said he, \\\"I'll break my staff and deeper than did ever plummet sound I'll drown my book.\\\"\\n\\nSo he made heavenly music to sound in the air, and appeared to them in his proper shape as the Duke of Milan.  Because they repented, he forgave them and told them the story of his life since they had cruelly committed him and his baby daughter to the mercy of wind and waves.  Alonso, who seemed sorriest of them all for his past crimes, lamented the loss of his heir.  But Prospero drew back a curtain and showed them Ferdinand and Miranda playing at chess.  Great was Alonso's joy to greet his loved son again, and when he heard that the fair maid with whom Ferdinand was playing was Prospero's daughter, and that the young folks had plighted their troth, he said--\\n\\n\\\"Give me your hands, let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart that doth not wish you joy.\\\"\\n\\nSo all ended happily.  The ship was safe in the harbor, and next day they all set sail for Naples, where Ferdinand and Miranda were to be married.  Ariel gave them calm seas and auspicious gales; and many were the rejoicings at the wedding.\\n\\nThen Prospero, after many years of absence, went back to his own dukedom, where he was welcomed with great joy by his faithful subjects.  He practiced the arts of magic no more, but his life was happy, and not only because he had found his own again, but chiefly because, when his bitterest foes who had done him deadly wrong lay at his mercy, he took no vengeance on them, but nobly forgave them.\\n\\nAs for Ariel, Prospero made him free as air, so that he could wander where he would, and sing with a light heart his sweet song--\\n\\n\\\"Where the bee sucks, there suck I:     In a cowslip's bell I lie;     There I couch when owls do cry.     On the bat's back I do fly     After summer, merrily:     Merrily, merrily, shall I live now,     Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.\\\"\\n\\nAS YOU LIKE IT\\n\\nThere was once a wicked Duke named Frederick, who took the dukedom that should have belonged to his brother, sending him into exile. His brother went into the Forest of Arden, where he lived the life of a bold forester, as Robin Hood did in Sherwood Forest in merry England.\\n\\nThe banished Duke's daughter, Rosalind, remained with Celia, Frederick's daughter, and the two loved each other more than most sisters.  One day there was a wrestling match at Court, and Rosalind and Celia went to see it.  Charles, a celebrated wrestler, was there, who had killed many men in contests of this kind.  Orlando, the young man he was to wrestle with, was so slender and youthful, that Rosalind and Celia thought he would surely be killed, as others had been; so they spoke to him, and asked him not to attempt so dangerous an adventure; but the only effect of their words was to make him wish more to come off well in the encounter, so as to win praise from such sweet ladies.\\n\\nOrlando, like Rosalind's father, was being kept out of his inheritance by his brother, and was so sad at his brother's unkindness that, until he saw Rosalind, he did not care much whether he lived or died.  But now the sight of the fair Rosalind gave him strength and courage, so that he did marvelously, and at last, threw Charles to such a tune, that the wrestler had to be carried off the ground. Duke Frederick was pleased with his courage, and asked his name.\\n\\n\\\"My name is Orlando, and I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys,\\\" said the young man.\\n\\nNow Sir Rowland de Boys, when he was alive, had been a good friend to the banished Duke, so that Frederick heard with regret whose son Orlando was, and would not befriend him.  But Rosalind was delighted to hear that this handsome young stranger was the son of her father's old friend, and as they were going away, she turned back more than once to say another kind word to the brave young man.\\n\\n\\\"Gentleman,\\\" she said, giving him a chain from her neck, \\\"wear this for me.  I could give more, but that my hand lacks means.\\\"\\n\\nRosalind and Celia, when they were alone, began to talk about the handsome wrestler, and Rosalind confessed that she loved him at first sight.\\n\\n\\\"Come, come,\\\" said Celia, \\\"wrestle with thy affections.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" answered Rosalind, \\\"they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.  Look, here comes the Duke.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"With his eyes full of anger,\\\" said Celia.\\n\\n\\\"You must leave the Court at once,\\\" he said to Rosalind.  \\\"Why?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"Never mind why,\\\" answered the Duke, \\\"you are banished.  If within ten days you are found within twenty miles of my Court, you die.\\\"\\n\\nSo Rosalind set out to seek her father, the banished Duke, in the Forest of Arden.  Celia loved her too much to let her go alone, and as it was rather a dangerous journey, Rosalind, being the taller, dressed up as a young countryman, and her cousin as a country girl, and Rosalind said that she would be called Ganymede, and Celia, Aliena.  They were very tired when at last they came to the Forest of Arden, and as they were sitting on the grass a countryman passed that way, and Ganymede asked him if he could get them food.  He did so, and told them that a shepherd's flocks and house were to be sold.  They bought these and settled down as shepherd and shepherdess in the forest.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Oliver having sought to take his brother Orlando's life, Orlando also wandered into the forest, and there met with the rightful Duke, and being kindly received, stayed with him. Now, Orlando could think of nothing but Rosalind, and he went about the forest carving her name on trees, and writing love sonnets and hanging them on the bushes, and there Rosalind and Celia found them.  One day Orlando met them, but he did not know Rosalind in her boy's clothes, though he liked the pretty shepherd youth, because he fancied a likeness in him to her he loved.\\n\\n\\\"There is a foolish lover,\\\" said Rosalind, \\\"who haunts these woods and hangs sonnets on the trees.  If I could find him, I would soon cure him of his folly.\\\"\\n\\nOrlando confessed that he was the foolish lover, and Rosalind said--\\\"If you will come and see me every day, I will pretend to be Rosalind, and I will take her part, and be wayward and contrary, as is the way of women, till I make you ashamed of your folly in loving her.\\\"\\n\\nAnd so every day he went to her house, and took a pleasure in saying to her all the pretty things he would have said to Rosalind; and she had the fine and secret joy of knowing that all his love-words came to the right ears.  Thus many days passed pleasantly away.\\n\\nOne morning, as Orlando was going to visit Ganymede, he saw a man asleep on the ground, and that there was a lioness crouching near, waiting for the man who was asleep to wake: for they say that lions will not prey on anything that is dead or sleeping.  Then Orlando looked at the man, and saw that it was his wicked brother, Oliver, who had tried to take his life.  He fought with the lioness and killed her, and saved his brother's life.\\n\\nWhile Orlando was fighting the lioness, Oliver woke to see his brother, whom he had treated so badly, saving him from a wild beast at the risk of his own life.  This made him repent of his wickedness, and he begged Orlando's pardon, and from thenceforth they were dear brothers.  The lioness had wounded Orlando's arm so much, that he could not go on to see the shepherd, so he sent his brother to ask Ganymede to come to him.\\n\\nOliver went and told the whole story to Ganymede and Aliena, and Aliena was so charmed with his manly way of confessing his faults, that she fell in love with him at once.  But when Ganymede heard of the danger Orlando had been in she fainted; and when she came to herself, said truly enough, \\\"I should have been a woman by right.\\\"\\n\\nOliver went back to his brother and told him all this, saying, \\\"I love Aliena so well that I will give up my estates to you and marry her, and live here as a shepherd.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let your wedding be to-morrow,\\\" said Orlando, \\\"and I will ask the Duke and his friends.\\\"\\n\\nWhen Orlando told Ganymede how his brother was to be married on the morrow, he added: \\\"Oh, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes.\\\"\\n\\nThen answered Rosalind, still in Ganymede's dress and speaking with his voic--\\\"If you do love Rosalind so near the heart, then when your brother marries Aliena, shall you marry her.\\\"\\n\\nNow the next day the Duke and his followers, and Orlando, and Oliver, and Aliena, were all gathered together for the wedding.\\n\\nThen Ganymede came in and said to the Duke, \\\"If I bring in your daughter Rosalind, will you give her to Orlando here?\\\"  \\\"That I would,\\\" said the Duke, \\\"if I had all kingdoms to give with her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you say you will have her when I bring her?\\\" she said to Orlando.  \\\"That would I,\\\" he answered, \\\"were I king of all kingdoms.\\\"\\n\\nThen Rosalind and Celia went out, and Rosalind put on her pretty woman's clothes again, and after a while came back.\\n\\nShe turned to her father--\\\"I give myself to you, for I am yours.\\\" \\\"If there be truth in sight,\\\" he said, \\\"you are my daughter.\\\"\\n\\nThen she said to Orlando, \\\"I give myself to you, for I am yours.\\\" \\\"If there be truth in sight,\\\" he said, \\\"you are my Rosalind.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will have no father if you be not he,\\\" she said to the Duke, and to Orlando, \\\"I will have no husband if you be not he.\\\"\\n\\nSo Orlando and Rosalind were married, and Oliver and Celia, and they lived happy ever after, returning with the Duke to the kingdom. For Frederick had been shown by a holy hermit the wickedness of his ways, and so gave back the dukedom of his brother, and himself went into a monastery to pray for forgiveness.\\n\\nThe wedding was a merry one, in the mossy glades of the forest. A shepherd and shepherdess who had been friends with Rosalind, when she was herself disguised as a shepherd, were married on the same day, and all with such pretty feastings and merrymakings as could be nowhere within four walls, but only in the beautiful green wood.\\n\\nTHE WINTER'S TALE\\n\\nLeontes was the King of Sicily, and his dearest friend was Polixenes, King of Bohemia.  They had been brought up together, and only separated when they reached man's estate and each had to go and rule over his kingdom.  After many years, when each was married and had a son, Polixenes came to stay with Leontes in Sicily.\\n\\nLeontes was a violent-tempered man and rather silly, and he took it into his stupid head that his wife, Hermione, liked Polixenes better than she did him, her own husband.  When once he had got this into his head, nothing could put it out; and he ordered one of his lords, Camillo, to put a poison in Polixenes' wine.  Camillo tried to dissuade him from this wicked action, but finding he was not to be moved, pretended to consent.  He then told Polixenes what was proposed against him, and they fled from the Court of Sicily that night, and returned to Bohemia, where Camillo lived on as Polixenes' friend and counselor.\\n\\nLeontes threw the Queen into prison; and her son, the heir to the throne, died of sorrow to see his mother so unjustly and cruelly treated.\\n\\nWhile the Queen was in prison she had a little baby, and a friend of hers, named Paulina, had the baby dressed in its best, and took it to show the King, thinking that the sight of his helpless little daughter would soften his heart towards his dear Queen, who had never done him any wrong, and who loved him a great deal more than he deserved; but the King would not look at the baby, and ordered Paulina's husband to take it away in a ship, and leave it in the most desert and dreadful place he could find, which Paulina's husband, very much against his will, was obliged to do.\\n\\nThen the poor Queen was brought up to be tried for treason in preferring Polixenes to her King; but really she had never thought of anyone except Leontes, her husband.  Leontes had sent some messengers to ask the god, Apollo, whether he was not right in his cruel thoughts of the Queen.  But he had not patience to wait till they came back, and so it happened that they arrived in the middle of the trial.  The Oracle said--\\n\\n\\\"Hermione is innocent, Polixenes blameless, Camillo a true subject, Leontes a jealous tyrant, and the King shall live without an heir, if that which is lost be not found.\\\"\\n\\nThen a man came and told them that the little Prince was dead. The poor Queen, hearing this, fell down in a fit; and then the King saw how wicked and wrong he had been.  He ordered Paulina and the ladies who were with the Queen to take her away, and try to restore her.  But Paulina came back in a few moments, and told the King that Hermione was dead.\\n\\nNow Leontes' eyes were at last opened to his folly.  His Queen was dead, and the little daughter who might have been a comfort to him he had sent away to be the prey of wolves and kites.  Life had nothing left for him now.  He gave himself up to his grief, and passed in any sad years in prayer and remorse.\\n\\nThe baby Princess was left on the seacoast of Bohemia, the very kingdom where Polixenes reigned.  Paulina's husband never went home to tell Leontes where he had left the baby; for as he was going back to the ship, he met a bear and was torn to pieces.  So there was an end of him.\\n\\nBut the poor deserted little baby was found by a shepherd.  She was richly dressed, and had with her some jewels, and a paper was pinned to her cloak, saying that her name was Perdita, and that she came of noble parents.\\n\\nThe shepherd, being a kind-hearted man, took home the little baby to his wife, and they brought it up as their own child.  She had no more teaching than a shepherd's child generally has, but she inherited from her royal mother many graces and charms, so that she was quite different from the other maidens in the village where she lived.\\n\\nOne day Prince Florizel, the son of the good King of Bohemia, was bunting near the shepherd's house and saw Perdita, now grown up to a charming woman.  He made friends with the shepherd, not telling him that he was the Prince, but saying that his name was Doricles, and that he was a private gentleman; and then, being deeply in love with the pretty Perdita, he came almost daily to see her.\\n\\nThe King could not understand what it was that took his son nearly every day from home; so he set people to watch him, and then found out that the heir of the King of Bohemia was in love with Perdita, the pretty shepherd girl.  Polixenes, wishing to see whether this was true, disguised himself, and went with the faithful Camillo, in disguise too, to the old shepherd's house.  They arrived at the feast of sheep-shearing, and, though strangers, they were made very welcome.  There was dancing going on, and a peddler was selling ribbons and laces and gloves, which the young men bought for their sweethearts.\\n\\nFlorizel and Perdita, however, were taking no part in this gay scene, but sat quietly together talking.  The King noticed the charming manners and great beauty of Perdita, never guessing that she was the daughter of his old friend, Leontes.  He said to Camillo--\\n\\n\\\"This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever ran on the green sward.  Nothing she does or seems but smacks of something greater than herself--too noble for this place.\\\"\\n\\nAnd Camillo answered, \\\"In truth she is the Queen of curds and cream.\\\"\\n\\nBut when Florizel, who did not recognize his father, called upon the strangers to witness his betrothal with the pretty shepherdess, the King made himself known and forbade the marriage, adding that if ever she saw Florizel again, he would kill her and her old father, the shepherd; and with that he left them.  But Camillo remained behind, for he was charmed with Perdita, and wished to befriend her.\\n\\nCamillo had long known how sorry Leontes was for that foolish madness of his, and he longed to go iback to Sicily to see his old master.  He now proposed that the young people should go there and claim the protection of Leontes.  So they went, and the shepherd went with them, taking Perdita's jewels, her baby clothes, and the paper he had found pinned to her cloak.\\n\\nLeontes received them with great kindness.  He was very polite to Prince Florizel, but all his looks were for Perdita.  He saw how much she was like the Queen Hermione, and said again and again--\\n\\n\\\"Such a sweet creature my daughter might have been, if I had not cruelly sent her from me.\\\"\\n\\nWhen the old shepherd heard that the King had lost a baby daughter, who had been left upon the coast of Bohemia, he felt sure that Perdita, the child he had reared, must be the King's daughter, and when he told his tale and showed the jewels and the paper, the King perceived that Perdita was indeed his long-lost child. He welcomed her with joy, and rewarded the good shepherd.\\n\\nPolixenes had hastened after his son to prevent his marriage with Perdita, but when he found that she was the daughter of his old friend, he was only too glad to give his consent.\\n\\nYet Leontes could not be happy.  He remembered how his fair Queen, who should have been at his side to share his joy in his daughter's happiness, was dead through his unkindness, and he could say nothing for a long time but--\\n\\n\\\"Oh, thy mother! thy mother!\\\" and ask forgiveness of the King of Bohemia, and then kiss his daughter again, and then the Prince Florizel, and then thank the old shepherd for all his goodness.\\n\\nThen Paulina, who had been high all these years in the King's favor, because of her kindness to the dead Queen Hermione, said--\\\"I have a statue made in the likeness of the dead Queen, a piece many years in doing, and performed by the rare Italian master, Giulio Romano.  I keep it in a private house apart, and there, ever since you lost your Queen, I have gone twice or thrice a day.  Will it please your Majesty to go and see the statue?\\\"\\n\\nSo Leontes and Polixenes, and Florizel and Perdita, with Camillo and their attendants, went to Paulina's house where there was a heavy purple curtain screening off an alcove; and Paulina, with her hand on the curtain, said--\\n\\n\\\"She was peerless when she was alive, and I do believe that her dead likeness excels whatever yet you have looked upon, or that the hand of man hath done.  Therefore I keep it lonely, apart. But here it is--behold, and say, 'tis well.\\\"\\n\\nAnd with that she drew back the curtain and showed them the statue. The King gazed and gazed on the beautiful statue of his dead wife, but said nothing.\\n\\n\\\"I like your silence,\\\" said Paulina; \\\"it the more shows off your wonder.  But speak, is it not like her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is almost herself,\\\" said the King, \\\"and yet, Paulina, Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing so old as this seems.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, not by much,\\\" said Polixenes.\\n\\n\\\"Al,\\\" said Paulina, \\\"that is the cleverness of the carver, who shows her to us as she would have been had she lived till now.\\\"\\n\\nAnd still Leontes looked at the statue and could not take his eyes away.\\n\\n\\\"If I had known,\\\" said Paulina, \\\"that this poor image would so have stirred your grief, and love, I would not have shown it to you.\\\"\\n\\nBut he only answered, \\\"Do not draw the curtain.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, you must not look any longer,\\\" said Paulina, \\\"or you will think it moves.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let be! let be!\\\" said the King.  \\\"Would you not think it breathed?\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1640141308,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"It may be said of Shakespeare, that from his works may be collected a system of civil and economical prudence\"},\"digest\":\"253JKAi1-6oTdimZ4flpl8mMAtdnDMOxhdcEsk5WBhE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x336f98da5BDeF1692C4dE51f67eafA44062a418E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NjBecMchHZbrt9v_-2YKpD3KOGdGIbvEjklMuqQvkVY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AOT5ZYdm5-IjTvKM4E8zcCe-7NxzrkbIvmbYbbU9jSw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3dThxsk9Vw2WEJ7ufxt7I2jwzWeCQhellvJs59WmxtlkeoahCIV9fsbffW0Lp85hFyep8pHT70j9GGytnQ4FQw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xeaff258f017ddfecd8ed83cc1b53e89063a8de78e0f4e6d5b3c5d0d4d1c9201f4ba6676b3476db9d2e9ef868a1dda76730d8bec9c9f785d412bcfd6fc13dc9c31b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NjBecMchHZbrt9v_-2YKpD3KOGdGIbvEjklMuqQvkVY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AOT5ZYdm5-IjTvKM4E8zcCe-7NxzrkbIvmbYbbU9jSw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"253JKAi1-6oTdimZ4flpl8mMAtdnDMOxhdcEsk5WBhE\"}"
