"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Read Time:** 13.5 min\\n\\n# 👋 Hello hello!\\n\\nFor those of you that read the last post, *Introducing Catching Z's*, it means the world to have you back for round two — we've got a super juicy entry this go around.\\n\\nFor those friends that are reading this for the first time, welcome! I'm so happy you found these pieces & hope that by the end of it you feel that it was time well spent.\\n\\nLet's introduce today’s topic: making sense of web3, blockchain, digital currencies & crypto. It's a big topic that everyone seems to have an opinion on, and to quote a friend of mine \\\"The whole space is so intimidating because it’s full of click-bait influencers that I can't help but think are up to some shady business.\\\"\\n\\n# 🤝 Why you should care\\n\\nThrow all your preconceived notions about crypto, bitcoin, blockchains & NFTs out of the window. The reason you should care about this topic is almost comically simple: web3, and the innovations to come from it, will fundamentally change the way humans interact with both information and property in the years to come.\\n\\n> Understanding web3 while it is still young will separate those who benefit from it from those who will spend their time playing catch up.\\n\\nI promise you, if you give me the 13.5 minutes required to read this post, I'll give you the knowledge (and tools!) you need to join the many others experiencing tomorrow’s technology today.\\n\\nHow to read this post: Under each sub-header, there will be a sentence describing what you’ll gain from that section. If you’ve already acquired that knowledge or would rather move forward, feel free to skip it. The article sections are modular - read what’s valuable to you.\\n\\n# 👥 Who this post is meant for\\n\\n1. **Primary Audience:** People that are confused why everyone keeps talking about web3, crypto, NFTs, etc.\\n2. **Secondary Audience:** Young professionals who are within a decade of work experience. These are the folks who will grow up as web3 does.\\n3. **Tertiary Audience:** Parents of children that want to understand what this means for their child's life. I firmly believe this will define how children experience the 21st century and beyond.\\n\\nNote: This entry was written assuming the reader has almost no understanding of web3.\\n\\n# 🖋 Defining the basic lingo\\n\\nIn this section, you will learn the fundamental attributes that define web3.\\n\\n* **web3:** The same way *Millennial* refers to people born between 1980 and 1995, web3 refers to technologies born in the current generation of the internet. Simple as that. The only difference between humans and technology is that in the world of technology, generations overlap *a lot.* Because of those overlaps, it doesn't always make sense to measure generations using time. Instead, we measure generations by whatever attributes make them distinct from the previous. In the case of web3, the things that make it different from web2 are: Decentralization, encryption, digital ownership.\\n* **Decentralized:** This word tells you how many entities (either people or companies) are responsible for taking an action.\\n\\n  Centralized means \\\\[the number of entities doing some action\\\\] = 1\\n\\n  Decentralized means \\\\[the number of entities doing some action ≥ 2\\n* **Encryption:** This word tells you that whatever *thing* is “encrypted” is secure & cannot be opened unless you have the key.\\n* **Digital Ownership:** The same way you prove ownership in real life, except online. For example, if you own a home, you might show someone the deed to prove it is yours. web3 allows you to do this for property on the internet.\\n\\nNote: If you're thinking to yourself, \\\"Cool Zane - I still don't get the hype,\\\" that's exactly where you should be. These are the basics. With that said, If you're new to web3, go ahead and high-five yourself because you're already far far ahead of the majority of the world.\\n\\n# 💯 Today's big problems, tomorrow's big solution\\n\\nIn this section, you will see three real problems that web3 has the potential to solve. There are three examples listed, feel free to read as all or none of them.\\n\\nSaid simply, web3 can solve many of our biggest problems - and yes, problems that I'm sure you care about in your day-to-day life. Here are a few that come to mind.\\n\\n**(A)** Creators and artists making money from the beginning: Imagine that there was a former-teen-drama-acting, Canadian, aspiring R&B artist named Steak (a.k.a @PropanePapi) who is having a really hard time making ends meet. They make nothing from YouTube or SoundCloud, they don't have many fans & some other more famous artists just *had* to choose a name that sounded similar. This artist will eventually have to choose between their art & making a living. This is sad because they won't create new music and their small group of fans will never hear another track. Wink wink, [this is happening ](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/3lau-streaming-rights-royalties-nft-crypto-marketplace-1230638/)today.\\n\\nHow does web3 prevent this? Because of web3, Steak could hypothetically create an album (maybe called Certified Tenderloin Boy) and let his fans know that...\\n\\n1. They can buy unique \\\"versions\\\" of his album with their name on it as a collectible\\n2. They'll get to own that individual version and even allow others to play it for a fee paid to the owner (the fan)\\n3. 100% of the album proceeds would go to funding Steak's career.\\n\\nThat's better for everyone! Steak gets to make ends meet and therefore make new music, and their fans are happy because now more music is coming and they have a direct relationship with the artist. web3's #DigitalOwnership facilitates a way for this reality to come true.\\n\\n...thank you for enduring that prolonged Drake joke 😬\\n\\n**(B)** Companies & websites getting attacked and brought down: I'm willing to bet you that much of your life happens on the internet. Even parts of your life that you wouldn’t expect to be digital, have parts that are (e.g. filling up your car with gas). All of the companies & governments that provide these digital services can be fatally attacked and irreparably damaged, and [they have been](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/us/politics/pipeline-hack.html).\\n\\nHow does web3 prevent this? Companies & governments share the same vulnerability: they operate from a single system that can be targeted. Try this analogy: You're the queen of a medieval kingdom that’s under attack and you decide to collect all your citizens in one castle protected by one big wall. No matter how tall you make those walls, the enemy will eventually get a catapult big enough to throw things over the top. Fast forward a few hundred years and they might even invent a helicopter… then you're really a sitting 🦆. Now, what if instead of one kingdom and one castle, you decide to divide up your kingdom into hundreds (or millions) of smaller castles, all with their own walls with tunnels between them allowing your citizens to move between? If an attacker tries to take down your kingdom, they'll have to attack every wall, all at the same time to definitively say they've won. As the queen, if you get attacked you just move all your citizens from one castle, to the next one, to the next one, until the attack is over. That's what web3's #decentralization can do for companies & governments.\\n\\n**(C)** Patient records & personal data stolen: Picture this, you get an email from your hospital that says \\\"Hi, we're sorry to admit but we've been attacked and the sensitive personal info you gave us is now lost and someone we don't know has it.\\\" Surprise surprise, [this happened too](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/cyberattack-hits-major-u-s-hospital-system-n1241254).\\n\\nHow does web3 prevent this? Imagine if everyone piece of info about you had an old-school lock 🔒on the front and you (and/or whoever else you want) had the key 🔑. If that were the case, even though it would be super frustrating that have your info was lost, you'd at least know it would always be locked up safe and sound. That is web3's #encryption at work.\\n\\n# 🛠 Looking under the hood\\n\\nIn this section, you will learn what blockchains and cryptocurrencies are as well as how they both related to web3.\\n\\nThe core innovation of web3 is the use of the blockchain architecture & information encryption. [This article](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/explain-bitcoin-like-im-five-73b4257ac833) does a better job than I ever could of describing blockchains simply, but in a nutshell, a blockchain is a bunch of storage cabinets with pages of information, called blocks, connected to each other forming a chain. A chain of blocks! A blockchain!\\n\\nAt their core, blockchains are decentralized and encrypted.\\n\\nIf you're thinking to yourself, \\\"Okay but do these blockchains just come out of thin air or something?\\\" you're asking the right question. Blockchains are built and maintained by a bunch of people that raise their hands 🙋‍♀️ and say \\\"I'm going to give up my computer's ability to store and act on information to the blockchain.\\\" These people are called “Miners”.\\n\\nEventually, enough people raise their hands and the blockchain is born, each computer running and storing a little bit of the information on the chain. This is that whole decentralized phenomenon we mentioned earlier - lots of people maintaining a little part of the kingdom.\\n\\n\\\"But wait, Zane, you're telling me a bunch of strangers hold my information?!\\\"\\n\\nI reply, \\\"Yes, but don't forget: all the information has a lock on the front and only you have the key, so they can't do anything with it\\\"\\n\\nYou say, \\\"I'm still really weirded out by this. I'm not going to use the blockchain.\\\"\\n\\nI chime in, \\\"Do you ever use UPS or Amazon? If you do, then a bunch of strangers are already handling your information and property every day. Don’t you trust delivery drivers to not rip open your packages and take your valuables”?\\n\\nYou pause, think & fill up your iced tea.\\n\\nI wrap up, \\\"The beauty of the blockchain is that the people holding your information are quite literally unable to open anything because that’s how the code was set up in the beginning. The reason a Miner can't steal your information is the same reason you can't snap your fingers and turn into a dolphin🐬: because the laws that govern the blockchain and universe apply, of course to each respectively haha.”\\n\\nYou set down your glass and ask, \\\"So these miners just volunteer their computers for free? There has to be some reason they do this.\\\"\\n\\nI high-five you and say \\\"You're right! Miners are rewarded with something called cryptocurrency. It's called cryptocurrency because it is an encrypted currency. The more work a miner does to take care of the blocks, the more cryptocurrency they are rewarded. New coins are created when new blocks are born.\\\"\\n\\n> Another helpful analogy I use to explain the relationship between a cryptocurrency and a blockchain is that blockchains are like the human body & cryptocurrencies are the blood. For my body to function and do what it needs, it needs blood circulating around to reward the muscles and organs doing all the work! One cannot exist without the other.\\n\\n# 🐛 Did blockchains ever turn into anything?\\n\\nIn this section, you’ll learn about the first major blockchain & the most developed blockchain.\\n\\nLet’s build on this idea of storage cabinets and pages of information all linking together. Each storage cabinet is a “block” and as for what is stored within it, well that’s what makes each blockchain different.\\n\\nThe first blockchain to hit the mainstream is called the Bitcoin Blockchain and was invented by an anonymous rockstar named Satoshi Nakamoto. Here’s the [original document](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) he wrote that got the snowball rolling. The information that was stored in each block was pretty basic, each entry into the block contained only four pieces of information:\\n\\n![Bitcoin Blockchain Data Contents](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I1nUvC4XT_mJXBP6yMM2C.png?height=115&width=599)\\n\\n🎤 drop. That’s basically it. This is revolutionary. To transfer money today you have to open your *Apple* phone, maybe go to *Venmo,* link your bank account via *Plaid*, enter the payment information, then that gets sent from *Venmo,* to *Plaid,* to *Capital One* (or whoever you bank with), debits your account for the amount, wires the funds from your account back to *Venmo* to let your friend know they have the cash. Then for your friend to actually do anything with it, they have to go through a whole different process to turn the Venmo cash into actually usable money.\\n\\nThis becomes an even bigger issue when the amount of money is bigger and the payments start crossing borders. Lots of companies help you move money across borders, but always for a fee. If you’re a family struggling in a place like Syria, sometimes that fee is more than you can afford. Bitcoin liberated people’s financial well-being from the handcuffs of economic and civic instabilities plaguing much of the world.\\n\\n> Reread that again, in today’s world I need a paragraph to describe how you can send money to your friend, in tomorrow’s world I only need four words/phrases. It’s both beautiful and powerful.\\n\\nThe cryptocurrency that flows through the blockchain described above is called [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/).\\n\\nAs groundbreaking as the Bitcoin Blockchain was, someone named [Vitalik Buterin](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin) thought this idea could be even more powerful if we added a 5th piece of information: a condition.\\n\\n![Ethereum Blockchain Data Contents](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-SgjSqede3xUr59RMxOMT.png?height=156&width=826)\\n\\nAll together this reads, “If Jaideep high-fives Zane, then send $20 from Zane to Jaideep.” Once the condition is met, the money moves and is stamped with the time. The sentence above is what’s called a [Smart Contract](https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts). The advent of smart contracts, and logical “if this then that” types of actions is the basic building block of computers and apps. Because we can create these on a blockchain, we’re able to create apps and services on blockchains too. While this example was about a real-life high-five, blockchain smart contracts can only take digital conditions (e.g. if someone logs into this app, send $5)... for now 😉\\n\\nThe cryptocurrency that flows through the blockchain described above is called [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/).\\n\\nBecause you can build apps on top of Ethereum, similar to how you can build an app called TikTok on today’s internet, it’s become the industry favorite for developing products in web3.\\n\\n> An internet can be defined as a network that moves information. Blockchains meet this definition but in a decentralized way. Applications on the internet are called “apps,” while applications on the blockchain are called “dApps” short for decentralized applications.\\n\\nCheck out a [killer guide ](https://web3friends.substack.com/p/web3-starter-guide-)my good buddy Jaideep wrote about web3 that expands on the above and links to some great resources.\\n\\n# 🤘🏽What you can do with all of this\\n\\nIn this section, you’ll learn about some easy advantages of getting involved with web3.\\n\\n1. You can support [causes](https://mirror.xyz/0x8bF129a738d4E5FA34EBa2fe3cDE19611C05BffB/crowdfunds/0xb93c2EF7df18bf877990438Cc3382F6F17E5763B) and [creators](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/) that you care about with 100% assurance that every cent will go towards them. #virtueSignaling\\n2. You can get involved in organizations that will pay up to [thousands of percentage points APY](https://www.olympusdao.finance/) which definitely beats the savings account national average of around 0.06%\\n3. You can make incredible amounts of money by engaging with dApps in their early days and getting [rewarded retroactively](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/airdrop-cryptocurrency.asp)\\n4. You can make money [directly from people engaging with your conten](https://www.deso.org/)t vs. companies making money off of you via advertising.\\n\\nAnd the list goes on and on. While it may seem like the industry is already developed and you might be late to the party, I promise you we are still in the top of the first inning.\\n\\nThis entry was all about the core concepts you need to understand web3. If you actually want to put this to use, please scroll down to the “🐰 Let’s dive in” section to pick up where this left off.\\n\\n# 🧠 A quote I’ve been stewing on\\n\\nAndré de Sheilds three cardinal rules for his ability & longevity:\\n\\n1.

The cover art of the playlist was my first NFT, my #cryptofish 🐟 🙂\\n\\n\\\\--\\n\\n## Deluxe Content 👇🏽\\n\\n# 🐰 Let’s dive in\\n\\nHere’s the general flow you can use to engage with any part of web3:\\n\\n* **Step One:** Turn your current money (frequently referred to as “fiat”) into cryptocurrency.\\n* **Step Two:** Send your cryptocurrency to a wallet that you own\\n* **Step Three:** Find a dApp or service you’d like to engage with and connect your wallet\\n* **Step Four:** Enjoy the dApp or service\\n\\nBecause most of the exciting stuff in web3 is happening in Ethereum let’s focus on that for today.\\n\\n### 🪄 Step One: Turn Fiat to Crypto\\n\\nThere are lots of places you can go to turn your cash into crypto. The place I use for the time being is an app called [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/). They’ve got an iOS app and a website you can use to create an account, link your bank and purchase crypto. If you’d prefer to not use Coinbase, there are many other *Crypto Exchanges* you can use to purchase crypto.\\n\\nWhile many companies allow you to “invest” in crypto, not all of them allow you to use your crypto. Be sure that wherever you’re purchasing your Ethereum you have the ability to *send it to a wallet*. At the time that this entry was written, the following companies *do* *not* allow you to use send your crypto: Robinhood, Venmo, Paypal and CashApp.\\n\\nOnce you’ve got your account set up, go ahead and purchase some Ethereum. Transacting on Ethereum can be very expensive, this is a known and serious problem that many intelligent people are trying to fix. Because it can be expensive for the time being, I recommend purchasing around $300 USD if you’re able to.\\n\\n### 💸 Step Two: Sending your crypto to your wallet\\n\\nFor you to do anything to a blockchain, you need to exist on that blockchain. The way you exist, or claim your identity, is by setting up a wallet. Each blockchain has its own wallet.\\n\\n> In other words, the wallet you make to do things with bitcoin, is different from the wallet you use to do things with Ethereum, which is also different from the wallet you use to do things with DeSo (another blockchain).\\n\\nSince Ethereum is going to be our example today, we need to get you an Ethereum wallet. My favorite one and the one that’s most widely accepted is[ MetaMask](https://metamask.io/). There’s an iOS app as well as a Google Chrome extension that they offer. I recommend downloading both.\\n\\nI recommend creating your wallet on a computer rather than mobile. Once the Chrome Extension has been downloaded, click the “Get Started” button and go through the process of making your wallet. If you get stuck, here’s a [great guide](https://myterablock.medium.com/how-to-create-or-import-a-metamask-wallet-a551fc2f5a6b).\\n\\n> When you get to the stage where you’re given a bunch of words. It is absolutely critical that you write this phrase down and keep it safe. This is the key to your wallet. If someone gets it, either by accident or on purpose, they can use all of the contents of your wallet and there’s nothing, absolutely nothing you can do about it.\\n\\nNow that your wallet is created, I’m going to thank [Foundation](https://help.foundation.app/en/articles/4731452-a-complete-guide-to-getting-eth-and-a-wallet-with-metamask) for a great guide on getting your Ethereum into MetaMask:\\n\\n…Coinbase will let you know when your ETH is available to send out, which can take up to 2 days if you purchased it with a debit card or up to 15 days if you used a bank transfer. Once your ETH is ready, send it from Coinbase to your wallet by opening up the MetaMask browser extension. Click on “Account” to copy your Ethereum address. Your Ethereum wallet address—which is similar to a bank account number—will let you transfer and receive crypto from anyone, anywhere in the world.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZltVam_4E9JHtMt3XoAYT.png?height=512&width=311)\\n\\n**From the Coinbase website:** Now head back to[ www.coinbase.com](http://www.coinbase.com/), select “Portfolio,” and find “Ethereum.” Click “Send,” and paste in your Ethereum wallet address from MetaMask in the “To” field. Double-check that you pasted in the full 42-character wallet address, if you send crypto to the wrong address you will not be able to get it back. Click “Continue,” then “Confirm” to send your ETH, it should take a few minutes to transfer.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1X1iheQSLrOFxO2HESEEd.png?height=513&width=344)\\n\\n**From the Coinbase app:** Open the mobile app, and click on “Portfolio.” Find “Ethereum,” and select “ETH Wallet.” You should see your balance here. To send ETH to your wallet on MetaMask, click on the send icon in the top right. Enter the amount of ETH you want to send and click “Continue.” In the “To” field, paste in your Ethereum wallet address. Click “Preview” to confirm the amount and once you’re ready, hit “Send Now.” Wait a few minutes for the ETH to arrive in your wallet.\\n\\n### 🧭 Step Three: Find a dApp or service & connect your wallet\\n\\nThat jumble of numbers and letters is super ugly and hard for people to reference easily, especially if you’ll be sending money from place to place. To get around this, there's a handy dApp called [Ethereum Named Services ](https://ens.domains/)(ENS) that allows you to make a human-readable, nice link that points to your wallet address. That pointer is called your ENS domain. Most ENS domains end in “.eth” – mine main wallet is homsi.eth!\\n\\nFind your way to ENS and click “Go to App,” once there, connect your wallet, select MetaMask, and approve the pop-up in your MetaMask extension. Just like that, you’ve connected to your first dApp. ✋🏽 High five!\\n\\nYou can now search for possible domains names that are up for grabs. I highly recommend getting an ENS domain rather than keeping your wallet address as is. It is much easier to plug into the ecosystem when people can refer to you by something easy.\\n\\nOnce you’ve found a wallet address that’s available, go through the process of renting the address. Warning: it will be pricey… because of gas. Gas fees are something you have to pay to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. For you to do anything to the blockchain, you have to pay a miner to do it on your behalf, since technically your data is stored on their computer. Go through the purchase flow and your ENS domain name will be tied to your wallet. If you get stuck, here’s a [handy guide](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/tech/what-is-an-ens-domain).\\n\\n### 🤩 Step Four: Enjoy!\\n\\nNow you have a wallet, an ENS domain and some crypto to enjoy however you’d like. What we’ve done so far are the basics, with this you can now engage with any Ethereum supported dApp in web3 - which is just about most of them.\\n\\nAnother great dApp I recommend you use is [Rainbow.me](https://rainbow.me/). Rainbow is a tool that uses MetaMask’s technology, but dresses it up in a much more beautiful way. They have a great iOS app I recommend you download to view the contents of your wallet. You simply enter your ENS domain and you’ll be in the “Read” mode of the wallet. To transact from it, you’ll need to enter the security key that you had saved from your MetaMask wallet creation. Don’t worry, its safe 🙂\\n\\nTo use my wallet, I have the MetaMask and Rainbow iOS apps and the MetaMask Chrome extension on my laptop.\\n\\nNote: Wallets are transparent. Anyone can search your wallet address or ENS domain in Rainbow.me and see what’s inside. I have a public wallet as well a private one that no one knows the name of besides me.\\n\\nYou now have everything you need to enjoy web3. If you need more crypto, start at the top of the process and purchase some more, send it to your wallet, and continue on your journey. Some of my favorite dApps I recommend you explore include [OlympusDao](https://www.olympusdao.finance/), [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), and [SushiSwap](https://sushi.com/).\",\"timestamp\":1641331770,\"title\":\"no. 2 - Everything you need to understand web3 #DeluxeVersion\"},\"digest\":\"zN8GJxV8XfCLeJIxG_f6WCCKQ-EjbiJSQJ0Eni_5R5w\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xDd6aC7Db7D2BB76fB83deD797BF4BD22E5054578\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"heUGCavCnMQk7o-dnCXZBcJiGcEfWO6ACF-ufoJbjDs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_VmBYvM1M-q3lhkO4tkLwf-4RxLe-UttHq6SjW0xTp4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"jKtYL2kn47qLDvzvbpYQE7P2sTPRYpNCZZpG2PlyZP3XPVhtkJoj2cHDWNqgPMAmo42dran6rWLcHDNLACToOQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf81382fffc052764d79f5cabd749a61ca544514146adf59210ec49761a18b953619c145bf41c4f27e9a7f292cc109af4920b22756993cc01484c76d1ce143d271c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"heUGCavCnMQk7o-dnCXZBcJiGcEfWO6ACF-ufoJbjDs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_VmBYvM1M-q3lhkO4tkLwf-4RxLe-UttHq6SjW0xTp4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"JlQYOyVgM1Bp9UgVWjxb_e6200mEDQqXd7CCd2q0YLw\"}"
