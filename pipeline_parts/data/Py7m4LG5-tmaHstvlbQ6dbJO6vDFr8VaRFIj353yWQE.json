"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"his tunic fell around him in graceful folds, jewels adorned his arms, his brow was crowned with a golden wreath, and over his neck and shoulders flowed his hair perfumed with odors.  His left hand held the lyre, his right the ivory wand with which he struck its chords.  Like one inspired, he seemed to drink the morning air and glitter in the morning ray.  The seamen gazed with admiration.  He strode forward to the vessel's side and looked down into the blue sea.  Addressing his lyre, he sang, \\\"Companion of my voice, come with me to the realm of shades.  Though Cerberus may growl, we know the power of song can tame his rage. Ye heroes of Elysium, who have passed the darkling flood,   ye happy souls, soon shall I join your band.  Yet can ye relieve my grief?  Alas, I leave my friend behind me.  Thou, who didst find thy Eurydice, and lose her again as soon as found; when she had vanished like a dream, how didst thou hate the cheerful light!  I must away, but I will not fear.  The gods look down upon us.  Ye who slay me unoffending, when I am no more, your time of trembling shall come.  Ye Nereids, receive your guest, who throws himself upon your mercy!\\\"  So saying, he sprang into the deep sea.  The waves covered him, and the seamen held on their way, fancying themselves safe from all danger of detection.\\n\\nBut the strains of his music had drawn round him the inhabitants of the deep to listen, and dolphins followed the ship as if chained by a spell.  While he struggled in the waves, a dolphin offered him his back, and carried him mounted thereon safe to shore.  At the spot where he landed, a monument of brass was afterwards erected upon the rocky shore, to preserve the memory of the event.\\n\\nWhen Arion and the dolphin parted, each to his own element, Arion thus poured forth his thanks.  \\\"Farewell, thou faithful, friendly fish!  Would that I could reward thee; but thou canst not wend with me, nor I with thee.  Companionship we may not have.  May Galatea, queen of the deep, accord thee her favor, and thou, proud of the burden, draw her chariot over the smooth mirror of the deep.\\\"\\n\\nArion hastened from the shore, and soon saw before him the towers of Corinth.  He journeyed on, harp in hand, singing as he went, full of love and happiness, forgetting his losses, and mindful only of what remained, his friend and his lyre.  He entered the hospitable halls, and was soon clasped in the embrace of Periander.  \\\"I come back to thee, my friend,\\\" he said.  \\\"The talent which a god bestowed has been the delight of thousands, but false knaves have stripped me of my well-earned treasure; yet I retain the consciousness of wide-spread fame.\\\"  Then he told Periander all the wonderful events that had befallen him, who heard him with amazement.  \\\"Shall such wickedness triumph?\\\" said he.  \\\"Then in vain is power lodged in my hands.  That we may discover the criminals, you must remain here in concealment, and so they will approach without suspicion.\\\"  When the ship arrived in the harbor, he summoned the mariners before him.  \\\"Have you heard anything of Arion?\\\" he inquired.  \\\"I anxiously look for his return.\\\" They replied, \\\"We left him well and prosperous in Tarentum.\\\"  As they said these words, Arion stepped forth and faced them.  His well proportioned limbs were arrayed in gold and purple fair to see, his tunic fell around him in graceful folds, jewels adorned his arms, his brow was crowned with a golden wreath, and over his neck and shoulders flowed his hair perfumed with odors; his left hand held the lyre, his right the ivory wand with which he struck its chords.  They fell prostrate at his feet, as if a lightning bolt had struck them.  \\\"We meant to murder him, and he has become a god.  O Earth, open and receive us!\\\"  Then Periander spoke.  \\\"He lives, the master of the lay! Kind Heaven protects the poet's life.  As for you, I invoke not the spirit of vengeance; Arion wishes not your blood.  Ye slaves of avarice, begone!  Seek some barbarous land, and never may aught beautiful delight your souls!\\\"\\n\\nSpencer represents Arion, mounted on his dolphin, accompanying the train of Neptune and Amphitrite:\\n\\n\\\"Then was there heard a most celestial sound Of dainty music which did next ensue, And, on the floating waters as enthroned, Arion with his harp unto him drew The ears and hearts of all that goodly crew; Even when as yet the dolphin which him bore Through the Aegean Seas from pirates' view, Stood still, by him astonished at his love, And all the raging seas for joy forgot to roar.\\\"\\n\\nByron, in his Childe Harold, Canto II., alludes to the story of Arion, when, describing his voyage, he represents one of the seamen making music to entertain the rest:\\n\\n\\\"The moon is up; by Heaven, a lovely eve! Long streams of light o'er dancing waves expand; Now lads on shore may sigh and maids believe; Such be our fate when we return to land! Meantime some rude Arion's restless hand Wakes the brisk harmony that sailors love; A circle there of merry listeners stand, Or to some well-known measure featly move Thoughtless as if on shore they still were free to rove.\\\"\\n\\nIBYCUS\\n\\nIn order to understand the story of Ibycus which follows, it is necessary to remember, first, that the theatres of the ancients were immense buildings providing seats for from ten to thirty thousand spectators, and as they were used only on festal occasions, and admission was free to all, they were usually filled.  They were without roofs and open to the sky, and the performances were in the daytime.  Secondly, the appalling representation of the Furies is not exaggerated in the story.  It is recorded that AEschylus, the tragic poet, having on one occasion represented the Furies in a chorus of fifty performers, the terror of the spectators was such that many fainted and were thrown into convulsions, and the magistrates forbade a like representation for the future.\\n\\nIbycus, the pious poet, was on his way to the chariot races and musical competitions held at the Isthmus of Corinth, which attracted all of Grecian lineage.  Apollo had bestowed on him the gift of song, the honeyed lips of the poet, and he pursued his way with lightsome step, full of the god.  Already the towers of Corinth crowning the height appeared in view, and he had entered with pious awe the sacred grove of Neptune.  No living object was in sight, only a flock of cranes flew overhead, taking the same course as himself in their migration to a southern clime.  \\\"Good luck to you, ye friendly squadrons,\\\" he exclaimed, \\\"my companions from across the sea.  I take your company for a good omen.  We come from far, and fly in search of hospitality.  May both of us meet that kind reception which shields the stranger guest from harm!\\\"\\n\\nHe paced briskly on, and soon was in the middle of the wood. There suddenly, at a narrow pass, two robbers stepped forth and barred his way.  He must yield or fight.  But his hand, accustomed to the lyre and not to the strife of arms, sank powerless.  He called for help on men and gods, but his cry reached no defender's ear.  \\\"Then here must I die,\\\" said he, \\\"in a strange land, unlamented, cut off by the hand of outlaws, and see none to avenge my cause.\\\"  Sore wounded he sank to the earth, when hoarse screamed the cranes overhead.  \\\"Take up my cause, ye cranes,\\\" he said, \\\"since no voice but yours answers to my cry.\\\" So saying, he closed his eyes in death.\\n\\nThe body, despoiled and mangled, was found, and though disfigured with wounds, was recognized by the friend in Corinth who had expected him as a guest.  \\\"Is it thus I find you restored to me?\\\" he exclaimed; \\\"I who hoped to entwine your temples with the wreath of triumph in the strife of song!\\\"\\n\\nThe guests assembled at the festival heard the tidings with dismay.  All Greece felt the wound, every heart owned its loss. They crowded round the tribunal of the magistrates, and demanded vengeance on the murderers and expiation with their blood.\\n\\nBut what trace or mark shall point out the perpetrator from amidst the vast multitude attracted by the splendor of the feat? Did he fall by the hands of robbers, or did some private enemy slay him?  The all-discerning sun alone can tell, for no other eye beheld it.  Yet not improbably the murderer even now walks in the midst of the throng, and enjoys the fruits of his crime, while vengeance seeks for him in vain.  Perhaps in their own temple's enclosure he defies the gods, mingling freely in this throng of men that now presses into the ampitheatre.\\n\\nFor now crowded together, row on row, the multitude fill the seats till it seems as if the very fabric would give way.  The murmur of voices sounds like the roar of the sea, while the circles widening in their ascent rise, tier on tier, as if they would reach the sky.\\n\\nAnd now the vast assemblage listens to the awful voice of the chorus personating the Furies, which in solemn guise advances with measured step, and moves around the circuit of the theatre. Can they be mortal women who compose that awful group, and can that vast concourse of silent forms be living beings!\\n\\nThe choristers, clad in black, bore in their fleshless hands torches blazing with a pitchy flame.  Their cheeks were bloodless, and in place of hair, writing and swelling serpents curled around their brows.  Forming a circle, these awful beings sang their hymn, rending the hearts of the guilty, and enchaining all their faculties.  It rose and swelled, overpowering the sound of the instruments, stealing the judgment, palsying the heart, curdling the blood.\\n\\n\\\"Happy the man who keeps his heart pure from guilt and crime! Him we avengers touch not; he treads the path of life secure from us.  But woe!  Woe!  To him who has done the deed of secret murder.  We, the fearful family of Night, fasten ourselves upon his whole being.  Thinks he by flight to escape us?  We fly still faster in pursuit, twine our snakes around his feet and bring him to the ground.  Unwearied we pursue; no pity checks our course; still on and on to the end of life, we give him no peace nor rest.\\\"  Thus the Eumenides sang, and moved in solemn cadence, while stillness like the stillness of death sat over the whole assembly as if in the presence of superhuman beings; and then in solemn march completing the circuit of the theatre, they passed out at the back of the stage.\\n\\nEvery heart fluttered between illusion and reality, and every breast panted with undefined terror, quailing before the awful power that watches secret crimes and winds unseen the skein of destiny.  At that moment a cry burst forth from one of the uppermost benches   \\\"Look!  Look!  Comrade, yonder are the cranes of Ibycus!\\\"  And suddenly there appeared sailing across the sky a dark object which a moment's inspection showed to be a flock of cranes flying directly over the theatre.  \\\"Of Ibycus! did he say?\\\"  The beloved name revived the sorrow in every breast.  As wave follows wave over the face of the sea, so ran from mouth to mouth the words, \\\"Of Ibycus!  Him whom we all lament, with some murderer's hand laid low!  What have the cranes to do with him?\\\" And louder grew the swell of voices, while like a lightning's flash the thought sped through every heart, \\\"Observe the power of the Eumenides!  The pious poet shall be avenged!  The murderer has informed against himself.  Seize the man who uttered that cry and the other to whom he spoke!\\\"\\n\\nThe culprit would gladly have recalled his words, but it was too late.  The faces of the murderers pale with terror betrayed their guilt.  The people took them before the judge, they confessed their crime and suffered the punishment they deserved.\\n\\nSIMONIDES\\n\\nSimonides was one of the most prolific of the early poets of Greece, but only a few fragments of his compositions have descended to us.  He wrote hymns, triumphal odes, and elegies. In the last species of composition he particularly excelled.  His genius was inclined to the pathetic, and none could touch with truer effect the chords of human sympathy.  The Lamentation of Danae, the most important of the fragments which remain of his poetry is based upon the tradition that Danae and her infant son were confined by order of her father Acrisius in a chest and set adrift on the sea.  The chest floated towards the island of Seriphus, where both were rescued by Dictys, a fisherman, and carried to Polydectes, king of the country, who received and protected them.  The child Perseus when grown up became a famous hero, whose adventures have been recorded in a previous chapter.\\n\\nSimonides passed much of his life at the courts of princes, and often employed his talents in panegyric and festal odes, receiving his reward from the munificence of those whose exploits he celebrated.  This employment was not derogatory, but closely resembles that of the earliest bards, such as Demodocus, described by Homer, or of Homer himself as recorded by tradition.\\n\\nOn one occasion when residing at the court of Scopas, king of Thessaly, the prince desired him to prepare a poem in celebration of his exploits, to be recited at a banquet.  In order to diversify his theme, Simonides, who was celebrated for his piety, introduced into his poem the exploits of Castor and Pollux.  Such digressions were not unusual with the poets on similar occasions, and one might suppose an ordinary mortal might have been content to share the praises of the sons of Leda.  But vanity is exacting; and as Scopas sat at his festal board among his courtiers and sycophants, he grudged every verse that did not rehearse his own praises.  When Simonides approached to receive the promised reward Scopas bestowed but half the expected sum, saying, \\\"Here is payment for my portion of the performance, Castor and Pollux will doubtless compensate thee for so much as relates to them.\\\"  The disconcerted poet returned to his seat amidst the laughter which followed the great man's jest.  In a little time he received a message that two young men on horseback were waiting without and anxious to see him.  Simonides hastened to the door, but looked in vain for the visitors.  Scarcely however had he left the banqueting-hall when the roof fell in with a loud crash, burying Scopas and all his guests beneath the ruins.  On inquiring as to the appearance of the young men who had sent for him, Simonides was satisfied that they were no other than Castor and Pollux themselves.\\n\\nSappho\\n\\nSappho was a poetess who flourished in a very early age of Greek literature.  Of her works few fragments remain, but they are enough to establish her claim to eminent poetical genius.  The story of Sappho commonly alluded to is that she was passionately in love with a beautiful youth named Phaon, and failing to obtain a return of affection she threw herself from the promontory of Leucadia into the sea, under a superstition that those who should take that \\\"Lover's-leap,\\\" would, if not destroyed, be cured of their love.\\n\\nByron alludes to the story of Sappho in Childe Harold, Canto II.:\\n\\nThose who wish to know more of Sappho and her leap, are referred to the Spectator, Nos. 223 and 229, and also to Moore's Evenings in Greece.\\n\\nChapter XIX Endymion.   Orion.   Aurora and Tithonus.   Acis and Galatea\\n\\nEndymion was a beautiful youth who fed his flock on Mount Latmos. One calm, clear night, Diana, the Moon, looked down and saw him sleeping.  The cold heart of the virgin goddess was warmed by his surpassing beauty, and she came down to him, kissed him, and watched over him while he slept.\\n\\nAnother story was that Jupiter bestowed on him the gift of perpetual youth united with perpetual sleep.  Of one so gifted we can have but few adventures to record.  Diana, it was said, took care that his fortunes should not suffer by his inactive life, for she made his flock increase, and guarded his sheep and lambs from the wild beasts.\\n\\nThe story of Endymion has a peculiar charm from the human meaning which it so thinly veils.  We see in Endymion the young poet, his fancy and his heart seeking in vain for that which can satisfy them, finding his favorite hour in the quiet moonlight, and nursing there beneath the beams of the bright and silent witness the melancholy and the ardor which consumes him.  The story suggests aspiring and poetic love, a life spent more in dreams than in reality, and an early and welcome death. S. G. Bulfinch\\n\\nThe Endymion of Keats is a wild and fanciful poem, containing some exquisite poetry, as this, to the moon:\\n\\n\\\"The sleeping kine Couched in thy brightness dream of fields divine. Innumerable mountains rise, and rise, Ambitious for the hallowing of thine eyes, And yet thy benediction passeth not One obscure hiding place, one little spot Where pleasure may be sent; the nested wren Has thy fair face within its tranquil ken.\\\"\\n\\nDr. Young in the Night Thoughts alludes to Endymion thus:\\n\\n\\\"These thoughts, O Night, are thine; >From thee they came like lovers' secret sighs, While others slept.  So Cynthia, poets feign, In shadows veiled, soft, sliding from her sphere, Her shepherd cheered, of her enamored less Than I of thee.\\\"\\n\\nFletcher, in the Faithful Shepherdess, tells,\\n\\n\\\"How the pale Phoebe, hunting in a grove, First saw the boy Endymion, from whose eyes She took eternal fire that never dies; How she conveyed him softly in a sleep, His temples bound with poppy, to the steep Head of Old Latmos, where she stoops each night, Gilding the mountain with her brother's light, To kiss her sweetest.\\\"\\n\\nORION\\n\\nOrion was the son of Neptune.  He was a handsome giant and a mighty hunter.  His father gave him the power of wading through the depths of the sea, or as others say, of walking on its surface.\\n\\nOrion loved Merope, the daughter of Oenopion, king of Chios, and sought her in marriage.  He cleared the island of wild beasts, and brought the spoils of the chase as presents to his beloved; but as Oenopion constantly deferred his consent, Orion attempted to gain possession of the maiden by violence.  Her father, incensed at this conduct, having made Orion drunk, deprived him of his sight, and cast him out on the sea shore.  The blinded hero followed the sound of the Cyclops' hammer till he reached Lemnos, and came to the forge of Vulcan, who, taking pity on him, gave him Kedalion, one of his men, to be his guide to the abode of the sun.  Placing Kedalion on his shoulders, Orion proceeded to the east, and there meeting the sun-god, was restored to sight by his beam.\\n\\nAfter this he dwelt as a hunter with Diana, with whom he was a favorite, and it is even said she was about to marry him.  Her brother was highly displeased and often chid her, but to no purpose.  One day, observing Orion wading though the sea with his head just above the water, Apollo pointed it out to his sister and maintained that she could not hit that black thing on the sea.  The archer-goddess discharged a shaft with fatal aim.  The waves rolled the dead body of Orion to the land, and bewailing her fatal error with many tears, Diana placed him among the stars, where he appears as a giant, with a girdle, sword, lion's skin, and club.  Sirius, his dog, follows him, and the Pleiads fly before him.\\n\\nThe Pleiads were daughters of Atlas, and nymphs of Diana's train. One day Orion saw them, and became enamored, and pursued them. In their distress they prayed to the gods to change their form, and Jupiter in pity turned them into pigeons, and then made them a constellation in the sky.  Though their numbers was seven, only six stars are visible, for Electra, one of them, it is said, left her place that she might not behold the ruin of Troy, for that city was founded by her son Dardanus.  The sight had such an effect on her sisters that they have looked pale ever since.\\n\\nMr. Longfellow has a poem on the \\\"Occultation of Orion.\\\"  The following lines are those in which he alludes to the mythic story.  We must premise that on the celestial globe Orion is represented as robed in a lion's skin and wielding a club.  At the moment the stars of the constellation one by one were quenched in the light of the moon, the poet tells us,\\n\\n\\\"Down fell the red skin of the lion Into the river at his feet. His mighty club no longer beat The forehead of the bull; but he Reeled as of yore beside the sea, When blinded by Oenopion He sought the blacksmith at his forge, And climbing up the narrow gorge, Fixed his blank eyes upon the sun.\\\"\\n\\nTennyson has a different theory of the Pleiads:\\n\\n\\\"Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising through the mellow shade, Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid.\\\" Locksley Hall\\n\\nByron alludes to the lost Pleiad:\\n\\n\\\"Like the lost Pleiad seen no more below.\\\"\\n\\nSee also Mrs. Heman's verses on the same subject.\\n\\nAURORA AND TITHONUS.\\n\\nAurora, the goddess of the Dawn, like her sister the Moon, was at times inspired with the love of mortals.  Her greatest favorite was Tithonus, son of Laomedon, king of Troy.  She stole him away, and prevailed on Jupiter to grant him immortality; but forgetting to have youth joined in the gift, after some time she began to discern, to her great mortification, that he was growing old. When his hair was quite white she left his society; but he still had the range of her palace, lived on ambrosial food, and was clad in celestial raiment.  At length he lost the power of using his limbs, and then she shut him up in his chamber, whence his feeble voice might at times be heard.  Finally she turned him into a grasshopper.\\n\\nMemnon was the son of aurora and Tithonus.  He was king of the AEthiopians, and dwelt in the extreme east, on the shore of Ocean.  He came with his warriors to assist the kindred of his father in the war of Troy.  King Priam received him with great honors, and listened with admiration to his narrative of the wonders of the ocean shore.\\n\\nThe very day after his arrival, Memnon, impatient of repose, led his troops to the field.  Antilochus, the brave son of Nestor, fell by his hand, and the Greeks were put to flight, when Achilles appeared and restored the battle.  A long and doubtful contest ensued between him and the son of Aurora; at length victor declared for Achilles, Memnon fell, and the Trojans fled in dismay.\\n\\nAurora, who, from her station in the sky, had viewed with apprehension the danger of her son, when she saw him fall directed his brothers, the Winds, to convey his body to the banks of the river Esepus in Paphlagonia.  In the evening Aurora came, accompanied by the Hours and the Pleiads, and wept and lamented over her son.  Night, in sympathy with her grief, spread the heaven with clouds; all nature mourned for the offspring of the Dawn.  The Aethiopians raised his tomb on the banks of the stream in the grove of the nymphs, and Jupiter caused the sparks and cinders of his funeral-pile to be turned into birds, which, dividing into two flocks, fought over the pile till they fell into the flame.  Every year, at the anniversary of his death, they return and celebrate his obsequies in like manner.  Aurora remains inconsolable for the loss of her son.  Her tears still flow, and may be seen at early morning in the form of dew-drops on the grass.\\n\\nUnlike most of the marvels of ancient mythology, there will exist some memorials of this.  On the banks of the river Nile, in Egypt, are two colossal statues, one of which is said to be the statue of Memnon.  Ancient writers record that when the first rays of the rising sun fall upon this statue, a sound is heard to issue from it which they compare to the snapping of a harp- string.  There is some doubt about the identification of the existing statue with the one described by the ancients, and the mysterious sounds are still more doubtful.  Yet there are not wanting some modern testimonies to their being still audible.  It has been suggested that sounds produced by confined air making its escape from crevices or caverns in the rocks may have given some ground for the story.  Sir Gardner Wilkinson, a late traveller, of the highest authority, examined the statue itself, and discovered that it was hollow, and that \\\"in the lap of the statue is a stone, which, on being struck, emits a metallic sound, that might still be made use of to deceive a visitor who was predisposed to believe its powers.\\\"\\n\\nThe vocal statue of Memnon is a favorite subject of allusion with the poets.  Darwin, in his Botanic Garden, says,\\n\\n\\\"So to the sacred Sun in Memnon's fane Spontaneous concords choired the matin strain; Touched by his orient beam responsive rings The living lyre and vibrates all its strings; Accordant aisles the tender tones prolong, And holy echoes swell the adoring song.\\\"\\n\\nACIS AND GALATEA\\n\\nScylla was a fair virgin of Sicily, a favorite of the Sea-Nymphs. She had many suitors, but repelled them all, and would go to the grotto of Galatea, and tell her how she was persecuted.  One day the goddess, while Scylla dressed her hair, listened to the story, and then replied, \\\"Yet, maiden, your persecutors are of the not ungentle race of men, whom if you will you can repel; but I, the daughter of Nereus, and protected by such a band of sisters, found no escape from the passion of the Cyclops but in the depths of the sea;\\\" and tears stopped her utterance, which when the pitying maiden had wiped away with her delicate finger, and soothed the goddess, \\\"Tell me, dearest,\\\" said she, \\\"the cause of your grief.\\\"  Galatea then said, \\\"Acis was the son of Faunus and a Naiad.  His father and mother loved him dearly, but their love was not equal to mine.  For the beautiful youth attached himself to me alone, and he was just sixteen years old, the down just beginning to darken his cheeks.  As much as I sought his society, so much did the cyclops seek mine; and if you ask me whether my love for Acis or my hatred for Polyphemus was the stronger, I cannot tell you; they were in equal measure.  Oh, Venus, how great is thy power!  This fierce giant, the terror of the woods, whom no hapless stranger escaped unharmed, who defied even Jove himself, learned to feel what love was, and touched with a passion for me, forgot his flocks and his well-stored caverns.  Then, for the first time, he began to take some care of his appearance, and to try to make himself agreeable; he harrowed those coarse locks of his with a comb, and mowed his beard with a sickle, looked at his harsh features in the water, and composed his countenance.  His love of slaughter, his fierceness and thirst of blood prevailed no more, and ships that touched at his island went away in safety.   He paced up and down the sea-shore, imprinting huge tracks with his heavy tread, and, when weary, lay tranquilly in his cave.\\n\\n\\\"There is a cliff which projects into the sea, which washes it on either side.  Thither one day the huge Cyclops ascended, and sat down while his flocks spread themselves around.  Laying down his staff which would have served for a mast to hold a vessel's sail, and taking his instrument, compacted of numerous pipes, he made the hills and the waters echo the music of his song.  I lay hid under a rock, by the side of my beloved Acis, and listened to the distant strain.  It was full of extravagant praises of my beauty, mingled with passionate reproaches of my coldness and cruelty.\\n\\n\\\"When he had finished he rose up, and like a raging bull, that cannot stand still, wandered off into the woods.  Acis and I thought no more of him, till on a sudden he came to a spot which gave him a view of us as we sat.  'I see you,' he exclaimed, 'and I will make this the last of your love-meetings.'  His voice was a roar such as an angry Cyclops alone could utter.  AEtna trembled at the sound.  I, overcome with terror, plunged into the water.  Acis turned and fled, crying, 'Save me, Galatea, save me, my parents!\\\"  The Cyclops pursued him, and tearing a rock from the side of the mountain hurled it at him.  Though only a corner of it touched him it overwhelmed him.\\n\\n\\\"All that fate left in my power I did for Acis.  I endowed him with the honors of his grandfather the river-god.   The purple blood flowed out from under the rock, but by degrees grew paler and looked like the stream of a river rendered turbid by rains, and in time it became clear.  The rock cleaved open, and the water, as it gushed from the chasm, uttered a pleasing murmur.\\\"\\n\\nThus Acis was changed into a river, and the river retains the name of Acis.\\n\\nChapter XX The Trojan War\\n\\nMinerva was the goddess of wisdom, but on one occasion she did a very foolish thing; she entered into competition with Juno and Venus for the prize of beauty.  It happened thus.  At the nuptials of Peleus and Thetis all the gods were invited with the exception of Eris, or Discord.  Enraged at her exclusion, the goddess threw a golden apple among the guests with the inscription, \\\"For the most beautiful.\\\"  Thereupon Juno, Venus, and Minerva, each claimed the apple.  Jupiter not willing to decide in so delicate a matter, sent the goddesses to Mount Ida, where the beautiful shepherd Paris was tending his flocks, and to him was committed the decision.  The goddesses accordingly appeared before him.  Juno promised him power and riches, Minerva glory and renown in war, and Venus the fairest of women for his wife, each attempting to bias his decision in her own favor. Paris decided in favor of Venus and gave her the golden apple, thus making the two other goddesses his enemies.  Under the protection of Venus, Paris sailed to Greece, and was hospitably received by Menelaus, king of Sparta.  Now Helen, the wife of Menelaus, was the very woman whom Venus had destined for Paris, the fairest of her sex.  She had been sought as a bride by numerous suitors, and before her decision was made known, they all, at the suggestion of Ulysses, one of their number, took an oath that they would defend her from all injury and avenge her cause if necessary.  She chose Menelaus, and was living with him happily when Paris became their guest.  Paris, aided by Venus, persuaded her to slope with him, and carried her to Troy, whence arose the famous Trojan war, the theme of the greatest poems of antiquity, those of Homer and Virgil.\\n\\nMenelaus called upon his brother chieftains of Greece to fulfil their pledge, and join him in his efforts to recover his wife. They generally came forward, but Ulysses, who had married Penelope and was very happy in his wife and child, had no disposition to embark in such a troublesome affair.  He therefore hung back and Palamedes was sent to urge him.  When Palamedes arrived at Ithaca, Ulysses pretended to be mad.  He yoked an ass and an ox together to the plough and began to sow salt. Palamedes, to try him, placed the infant Telemachus before the plough, whereupon the father turned the plough aside, showing plainly that he was no madman, and after that could no longer refuse to fulfil his promise.  Being now himself gained for the undertaking, he lent his aid to bring in other reluctant chiefs, especially Achilles.  This hero was the son of that Thetis at whose marriage the apple of Discord had been thrown among the goddesses.  Thetis was herself one of the immortals, a sea-nymph, and knowing that her son was fated to perish before Troy if he went on the expedition, she endeavored to prevent his going.  She sent him away to the court of king Lycomedes, and induced him to conceal himself in the disguise of a maiden among the daughters of the king.  Ulysses, hearing he was there, went disguised as a merchant to the palace and offered for sale female ornaments, among which he had placed some arms.  While the king's daughters were engrossed with the other contents of the merchant's pack, Achilles handled the weapons and thereby betrayed himself to the keen eye of Ulysses, who found no great difficulty in persuading him to disregard his mother's prudent counsels and join his countrymen in the war.\\n\\nPriam was king of Troy, and Paris, the shepherd and seducer of Helen, was his son.  Paris had been brought up in obscurity, because there were certain ominous forebodings connected with him from his infancy that he would be the ruin of the state.  These forebodings seemed at length likely to be realized, for the Grecian armament now in preparation was the greatest that had ever been fitted out.  Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, and brother of the injured Menelaus, was chosen commander-in-chief.  Achilles was their most illustrious warrior.  After him ranked Ajax, gigantic in size and of great courage, but dull of intellect, Diomedes, second only to Achilles in all the qualities of a hero, Ulysses, famous for his sagacity, and Nestor, the oldest of the Grecian chiefs, and one to whom they all looked up for counsel. But Troy was no feeble enemy.  Priam, the king, was now old, but he had been a wise prince and had strengthened his state by good government at home and numerous alliances with his neighbors. But the principal stay and support of his throne was his son Hector, one of the noblest characters painted by heathen antiquity.  Hector felt, from the first, a presentiment of the fall of his country, but still persevered in his heroic resistance, yet by no means justified the wrong which brought this danger upon her.  He was united in marriage with Andromache, and as a husband and father his character was not less admirable than as a warrior.  The principal leaders on the side of the Trojans, besides Hector, were Aeneas and Deiphobus, Glaucus and Sarpedon.\\n\\nAfter two years of preparation the Greek fleet and army assembled in the port of Aulis in Boeotia.  Here Agamemnon in hunting killed a stag which was sacred to Diana, and the goddess in return visited the army with pestilence, and produced a calm which prevented the ships from leaving the port.  Calchas the soothsayer thereupon announced that the wrath of the virgin goddess could only be appeased by the sacrifice of a virgin on her altar, and that none other but the daughter of the offender would be acceptable.  Agamemnon, however reluctant, yielded his consent, and the maiden Iphigenia was sent for under the pretence that she was to be married to Achilles.  When she was about to be sacrificed the goddess relented and snatched her away, leaving a hind in her place, and Iphigenia enveloped in a cloud was carried to Tauris, where Diana made her priestess of her temple.\\n\\nTennyson, in his Dream of Fair women, makes Iphigenia thus describe her feelings at the moment of sacrifice, the moment represented in our engraving:\\n\\n\\\"I was cut off from hope in that sad place, Which yet to name my spirit loathes and fears; My father held his hand upon his face; I, blinded by my tears,\\n\\n\\\"Still strove to speak; my voice was thick with sighs, As in a dream.  Dimly I could descry The stern black-bearded kings, with wolfish eyes, Waiting to see me die.\\n\\n\\\"The tall masts quivered as they lay afloat, The temples and the people and the shore; One drew a sharp knife through my tender throat Slowly, and    nothing more.\\\"\\n\\nThe wind now proving fair the fleet made sail and brought the forces to the coast of Troy.  The Trojans came to oppose their landing, and at the first onset Protesilaus fell by the hand of Hector.  Protesilaus had left at home his wife Laodamia, who was most tenderly attached to him.  When the news of his death reached her she implored the gods to be allowed to converse with him only three hours.  The request was granted.  Mercury led Protesilaus back to the upper world, and when he died a second time Laodamia died with him.  There was a story that the nymphs panted elm trees round his grave which grew very well till they were high enough to command a view of Troy, and then withered away, while fresh branches sprang from the roots.\\n\\nWordsworth has taken the story of Protesilaus and Laodamia for the subject of a poem.  It seems the oracle had declared that victory should be the lot of that party from which should fall the first victim to the war.  The poet represents Protesilaus, on his brief return to earth, as relating to Laodamia the story of his fate:\\n\\n\\\"The wished-for wind was given; I then revolved The oracle, upon the silent sea; And if no worthier led the way, resolved That of a thousand vessels mine should be The foremost prow impressing to the strand, Mine the first blood that tinged the Trojan sand.\\n\\n\\\"Yet bitter, ofttimes bitter was the pang When of thy loss I thought, beloved wife! On thee too fondly did my memory hang, And on the joys we shared in mortal life, The paths which we had trod,   these fountains, flowers; My new planned cities and unfinished towers.\\n\\n\\\"But should suspense permit the foe to cry, 'Behold they tremble!  Haughty their array, Yet of their number no one dares to die!'\\\" In soul I swept the indignity away; Old frailties then recurred; but lofty thought In act embodied my deliverance wrought. . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . Upon the side Of Hellespont (such faith was entertained) A knot of spiry trees for ages grew >From out the tomb of him for whom she died; And ever when such stature they had gained That Ilium's walls were subject to their view, The trees' tall summits withered at the sight, A constant interchange of growth and blight!\\\"\\n\\nTHE ILIAD\\n\\nThe war continued without decisive results for nine years.  Then an event occurred which seemed likely to be fatal to the cause of the Greeks, and that was a quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon.  It is at this point that the great poem of Homer, the Iliad, begins.  The Greeks, though unsuccessful against Troy, had taken the neighboring and allied cities, and in the division of the spoil a female captive, by name Chryseis, daughter of Chryses, priest of Apollo, had fallen to the share of Agamemnon. Chryses came bearing the sacred emblems of his office, and begged the release of his daughter.  Agamemnon refused.  Thereupon Chryses implored Apollo to afflict the Greeks till they should be forced to yield their prey.  Apollo granted the prayer of his priest, and sent pestilence into the Grecian camp.  Then a council was called to deliberate how to allay the wrath of the gods and avert the plague.  Achilles boldly charged their misfortunes upon Agamemnon as caused by his withholding Chryseis. Agamemnon enraged, consented to relinquish his captive, but demanded that Achilles should yield to him in her stead Briseis, a maiden who had fallen to Achilles' share in the division of the spoil.  Achilles submitted, but forthwith declared that he would take no further part in the war.  He withdrew his forces from the general camp and openly avowed his intention of returning home to Greece.\\n\\nThe gods and goddesses interested themselves as much in this famous war as the parties themselves.  It was well known to them that fate had decreed that Troy should fall, at last, if her enemies should persevere and not voluntarily abandon the enterprise.  Yet there was room enough left for chance to excite by turns the hopes and fears of the powers above who took part with either side.  Juno and Minerva, in consequence of the slight put upon their charms by Paris, were hostile to the Trojans; Venus for the opposite cause favored them.  Venus enlisted her admirer Mars on the same side, but Neptune favored the Greeks. Apollo was neutral, sometimes taking one side, sometimes the other, and Jove himself, though he loved the good King Priam, yet exercised a degree of impartiality; not however without exceptions.\\n\\nThetis, the mother of Achilles, warmly resented the injury done to her son.  She repaired immediately to Jove's palace, and besought him to make the Greeks repent of their injustice to Achilles by granting success to the Trojan arms.  Jupiter consented; and in the battle which ensued the Trojans were completely successful.  The Greeks were driven from the field, and took refuge in their ships.  Then Agamemnon called a council of his wisest and bravest chiefs.  Nestor advised that an embassy should be sent to Achilles to persuade him to return to the field; that Agamemnon should yield the maiden, the cause of the dispute, with ample gifts to atone for the wrong he had done. Agamemnon consented, and Ulysses, Ajax, and Phoenix were sent to carry to Achilles the penitent message.  They performed that duty, but Achilles was deaf to their entreaties.  He positively refused to return to the field, and persisted in his resolution to embark for Greece without delay.  The Greeks had constructed a rampart around their ships, and now, instead of besieging Troy, they were in a manner besieged themselves within their rampart. The next day after the unsuccessful embassy to Achilles, a battle was fought, and the Trojans, favored by Jove, were successful, and succeeded in forcing a passage through the Grecian rampart, and were about to set fire to the ships.  Neptune, seeing the Greeks so pressed, came to their rescue.  He appeared in the form of Calchas the prophet, encouraged the warriors with his shouts, and appealed to each individually till he raised their ardor to such a pitch that they forced the Trojans to give way.  Ajax performed prodigies of valor, and at length encountered Hector. Ajax shouted defiance, to which Hector replied, and hurled his lance at the huge warrior.  It was well aimed, and struck Ajax where the belts that bore his sword and shield crossed each other on the breast.  The double guard prevented its penetrating, and it fell harmless.  Then Ajax, seeing a huge stone, one of those that served to prop the ships, hurled it at Hector.  It struck him in the neck and stretched him on the plain.  His followers instantly seized him, and bore him off stunned and wounded.\\n\\nWhile Neptune was thus aiding the Greeks and driving back the Trojans, Jupiter saw nothing of what was going on, for his attention had been drawn from the field by the wiles of Juno. That goddess had arrayed herself in all her charms, and, to crown all, had borrowed of Venus her girdle called Cestus, which had the effect to heighten the wearer's charms to such a degree that they were quite irresistible.  So prepared, Juno went to join her husband, who sat on Olympus watching the battle.  When he beheld her she looked so charming that the fondness of his early love revived, and, forgetting the contending armies and all other affairs of state, he thought only of her and let the battle go as it would.\\n\\nBut this absorption did not continue long, and when, upon turning his eyes downward, he beheld Hector stretched on the plain almost lifeless from pain and bruises, he dismissed Juno in a rage, commanding her to send Iris and Apollo to him.  When Iris came he sent her with a stern message to Neptune, ordering him instantly to quit the field.  Apollo was dispatched to heal Hector's bruises and to inspirit his heart.  These orders were obeyed with such speed that while the battle still raged, Hector returned to the field and Neptune betook himself to his own dominions.\\n\\nAn arrow from Paris's bow wounded Machaon, son of Aesculapius, who inherited his father's art of healing, and was therefore of great value to the Greeks as their surgeon, besides being one of their bravest warriors.  Nestor took Machaon in his chariot and conveyed him from the field.  As they passed the ships of Achilles, that hero, looking out over the field, saw the chariot of Nestor and recognized the old chief, but could not discern who the wounded chief was.  So calling Patroclus, his companion and dearest friend, he sent him to Nestor's tent to inquire.\\n\\nPatroclus, arriving at Nestor's tent, saw Machaon wounded, and having told the cause of his coming would have hastened away, but Nestor detained him, to tell him the extent of the Grecian calamities.  He reminded him also how, at the time of departing for Troy, Achilles and himself had been charged by their respective fathers with different advice; Achilles to aspire to the highest pitch of glory, Patroclus, as the elder, to keep watch over his friend, and to guide his inexperience.  \\\"Now,\\\" said Nestor, \\\"is the time for such influence.  If the gods so please, thou mayest win him back to the common cause; but if not let hm at least send his soldiers to the field, and come thou, Patroclus, clad in his armor, and perhaps the very sight of it may drive back the Trojans.\\\"\\n\\nPatroclus was strongly moved with this address, and hastened back to Achilles, revolving in his mind all he had seen and heard.  He told the prince the sad condition of affairs at the camp of their late associates; Diomedes, Ulysses, Agamemnon, Machaon, all wounded, the rampart broken down, the enemy among the ships preparing to burn them, and thus to cut off all means of return to Greece.  While they spoke the flames burst forth from one of the ships.  Achilles, at the sight, relented so far as to grant Patroclus his request to lead the Myrmidons (for so were Achilles' soldiers called) to the field, and to lend him his armor that he might thereby strike more terror into the minds of the Trojans.  Without delay the soldiers were marshalled, Patroclus put on the radiant armor and mounted the chariot of Achilles, and led forth the men ardent for battle.  But before he went, Achilles strictly charged him that he should be content with repelling the foe.  \\\"Seek not,\\\" said he, \\\"to press the Trojans without me, lest thou add still more to the disgrace already mine.\\\"  Then exhorting the troops to do their best he dismissed them full of ardor to the fight.\\n\\nPatroclus and his Myrmidons at once plunged into the contest where it raged hottest; at the sight of which the joyful Grecians shouted and the ships reechoed the acclaim.  The Trojans, at the sight of the well-known armor, struck with terror, looked every where for refuge.  First those who had got possession of the ship and set it on fire left and allowed the Grecians to retake it and extinguish the flames.  Then the rest of the Trojans fled in dismay.  Ajax, Menelaus, and the two sons of Nestor performed prodigies of valor.  Hector was forced to turn his horses' heads and retire from the enclosure, leaving his men entangled in the fosse to escape as they could.  Patroclus drove them before him, slaying many, none daring to make a stand against him.\\n\\nAt last Sarpedon, son of Jove, ventured to oppose himself in fight to Patroclus.  Jupiter looked down upon him and would have snatched him from the fate which awaited him, but Juno hinted that if he did so it would induce all others of the inhabitants of heaven to interpose in like manner whenever any of their offspring were endangered; to which reason Jove yielded. Sarpedon threw his spear but missed Patroclus, but Patroclus threw his with better success.  It pierced Sarpedon's breast and he fell, and, calling to his friends to save his body from the foe, expired.  Then a furious contest arose for the possession of the corpse.  The Greeks succeeded and stripped Sarpedon of his armor; but Jove would not allow the remains of his son to be dishonored, and by his command Apollo snatched from the midst of the combatants the body of Sarpedon and committed it to the care of the twin brothers Death and Sleep, by whom it was transported to Lycia, the native land of Sarpedon, where it received due funeral rites.\\n\\nThus far Patroclus had succeeded to his utmost wish in repelling the Trojans and relieving his countrymen, but now came a change of fortune.  Hector, borne in his chariot, confronted him. Patroclus threw a vast stone at Hector, which missed its aim, but smote Cebriones, the charioteer, and knocked him from the car. Hector leaped from the chariot to rescue his friend, and Patroclus also decended to complete his victory.  Thus the two heroes met face to face.  At this decisive moment the poet, as if reluctant to give Hector the glory, records that Phoebus took part against Patroclus.  He struck the helmet from his head and the lance from his hand.  At the same moment an obscure Trojan wounded him in the back, and Hector pressing forward pierced him with his spear.  He fell mortally wounded.\\n\\nThen arose a tremendous conflict for the body of Patroclus, but his armor was at once taken possession of by Hector, who, retiring a short distance, divested himself of his own armor and put on that of Achilles, then returned to the fight.  Ajax and Menelaus defended the body, and Hector and his bravest warriors struggled to capture it.  The battle raged with equal fortune, when Jove enveloped the whole face of heaven with a dark cloud. The lightning flashed, the thunder roared, and Ajax, looking round for some one whom he might dispatch to Achilles to tell him of the death of his friend and of the imminent danger that his remains would fall into the hands of the enemy, could see no suitable messenger.  It was then that he exclaimed in those famous lines so often quoted,\\n\\n\\\"Father of heaven and earth!  Deliver thou Achaia's host from darkness; clear the skies; Give day; and, since thy sovereign will is such, Destruction with it; but, oh, give us day.\\\" Cowper.\",\"timestamp\":1641285640,\"title\":\"\\nHe clothed his well-proportioned limbs in gold and purple fair to see\"},\"digest\":\"xb_NQ2SpzCg4mDlaBfXg-gLTtP5os8usIxO5xmlWsew\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3F55F7d8879A09131180614410f6Ba3Af0a49E6d\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"03P5Hl9bkR68GJme9A6OO-0SHq-Z4a9p42Zt4gW0d5Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"S-xos7vAsH9b6wuZLp-r7fB9slCXPxPoJF1Xu60e1Cw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vHbpon0MHby40n27-YQDh2zEX0jltp8NkWOWzsQCToLiQr5CGFE1mNqCMR7aEnZfm13x4rSPXOuXGwghmTqV6A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf1bb63315dd95acc2ddef9a7680f099b08e3325e602fa1548a03e7017607816e246b185dec86941cecfd7070a8c8272d1cc591f4bcec998813d36a9e17f1dd311b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"03P5Hl9bkR68GJme9A6OO-0SHq-Z4a9p42Zt4gW0d5Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"S-xos7vAsH9b6wuZLp-r7fB9slCXPxPoJF1Xu60e1Cw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"xb_NQ2SpzCg4mDlaBfXg-gLTtP5os8usIxO5xmlWsew\"}"
